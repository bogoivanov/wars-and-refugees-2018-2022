90,200Statistics for forcibly displaced people and the 
population of concern to UNHCR
The main focus of this report is the analysis of statistical 
trends and changes in global forced displacement from 
January to December 2021 among populations for 
whom UNHCR has been entrusted with a responsibility 
by the international community.9 The data presented 
are based on information received as of 23 May 2022 
unless otherwise indicated. 
At the end of 2021, the total number of forcibly 
displaced people worldwide was 89.3 million, while 
the total population of concern to UNHCR stood at 
94.7 million people.10
The total number of forcibly displaced people 
encompasses refugees, asylum seekers, internally 
displaced people and Venezuelans displaced abroad. 
9 See the Methodology  page of UNHCR’s Refugee Data Finder for a definition of each population group.
10 See: What is the difference between population statistics for forcibly displaced and the population of concern to UNHCR?
11 See: UNHCR’s Refugee Data Finder  It includes refugees and other displaced people who 
are not covered by UNHCR’s mandate and excludes 
other categories such as returnees and non-displaced 
stateless people.
The total population of concern to UNHCR relates to 
the people UNHCR is mandated to protect and assist. 
It includes those who have been forcibly displaced; 
those who have returned within the previous year; 
those who are stateless (most of whom are not 
forcibly displaced); and other groups to whom 
UNHCR has extended its protection or provided 
assistance on a humanitarian basis.
These two categorizations are compared graphically 
below. A detailed breakdown of UNHCR’s population 
of concern by category and country is provided in 
Annex Table 1.

Global Forced 
Displacement
12 Source for internal displacement: Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC)
13 By end-2021, asylum seekers were able to access 121 countries, up from 108 at the start of the year and up from just 84 in mid-2020, see 
UNHCR’s COVID-19 Protection Issues dashboard  
14 See: Development and peace in uncertain times  
15 See: The Gender Dimensions of Forced Displacement – A Synthesis of New ResearchContinuing a worrying decade-long rising trend, the 
number of people forced to flee due to persecution, 
conflict, violence, human rights violations and events 
seriously disturbing public order climbed to 89.3 
million by the end of 2021. This is more than double 
the 42.7 million people who remained forcibly 
displaced at the end of 2012 and represents a sharp 
8 per cent increase of almost 7 million people in the 
span of just 12 months. As a result, above one per cent 
of the world’s population – or 1 in 88 people – were 
forcibly displaced at the end of 2021. This compares 
with 1 in 167 at the end of 2012.
During 2021, some 1.7 million people crossed 
international borders seeking protection and 14.4 
million new displacements within their countries 
were reported.12 This is a dramatic increase from the 
combined 11.2 million a year earlier. While internal 
displacement in 2021 was markedly higher than 
in recent years , the number of people crossing international borders seeking protection remained 
muted compared to pre-pandemic levels as health-
related border and travel restrictions remained in 
effect in many locations . Access to asylum did improve 
during the year,13 and most countries that remained 
closed to people seeking international protection at 
the end of 2021 had at least introduced some adaptive 
elements, albeit to varying degrees, rather than keep 
their asylum systems completely closed. 
The year was perhaps most notable for the sheer 
number of existing conflicts that escalated and new 
conflicts that flared up (see map 1). According to 
the World Bank, 23 countries, hosting a combined 
population of 850 million people, faced high- or 
medium-intensity conflicts in 2021.14 The number of 
conflict-affected countries has doubled during the last 
decade, with women and children disproportionately 
exposed to deep-rooted discrimination and extreme 
vulnerability.15Asylum seekers

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 1
Every year of the last decade, the numbers have climbed. 
Either the international community comes together to take 
action to address this human tragedy, resolve conflicts and 
find lasting solutions, or this terrible trend will continue.
Filippo Grandi  
UN High Commissioner for RefugeesMap 1 | New displacements in 2021
The number of Venezuelans 
displaced abroad grew by 
more than half a million, as 
COVID-19-related travel 
restrictions eased in the region.
Tens of thousands of new 
displacements were 
recorded in Mozambique.
The Central African Republic saw up 
to half a million new displacements 
within the country in 2021, triggered by 
election related violence and insecurity, 
with most returning during the year. 
Nearly three million people were displaced 
within the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, or across borders, with many 
returning during the year.
In Afghanistan, more than 900,000 
people were displaced within the 
country or to neighbouring countries, 
with many returning during the year.
The ongoing conﬂict in the Tigray 
region in Ethiopia led to several 
million more people being displaced 
within their country, with many 
returning during the year. 
Violent insurgencies in the Central 
Sahel region of Africa continued to 
drive internal displacement, with 
hundreds of thousands forced to 
ﬂee in Burkina Faso and Mali. 
Continued instability in the 
Syrian Arab Republic led to 
several hundred thousand 
new displacements. 
In South Sudan, an insurgency in the 
Equatoria region, and increasingly 
lethal intercommunal violence, 
triggered around half a million new 
displacements.
In Sudan, around half a million people 
were newly displaced within the 
country due to ongoing intercommunal 
conﬂict and violence that followed the 
military coup in October 2021. 
Almost 550,000 people were 
displaced in Somalia, with most 
estimated to have returned to 
their homes during the year. 
In Myanmar, the military takeover 
in February 2021 ignited violence 
and forced more than 400,000 
people to ﬂee within their country. 
In Nigeria, ﬁghting continued 
between government forces and 
non-state armed groups, with 
several hundred thousand people 
newly displaced during 2021. 
In Yemen, several hundred thousand 
people were newly displaced within 
their country, triggered by “among 
the worst” escalation of the conﬂict 
seen in recent years.
More than 100,000 new asylum 
applications were registered by 
Nicaraguans as they ﬂed the 
growing socio-political crisis 
and increasing political 
persecution in their country.
In Chad, tens of thousands 
were displaced within the 
country due to ongoing 
violent insurgencies. 
16 See: A decade of conflict in the Sahel leaves 2.5 million people displaced  
17 As of 29 May 2022, 7.1 million Ukrainians have been displaced internally (Source: IOM). From 24 February to 29 May 2022, 6.8 million refugee 
movements out of Ukraine were recorded, while 2.2 million population movements into Ukraine were recorded during the same period, 
including of a pendular nature (Source: Ukraine refugee situation ).In Afghanistan, the events leading up to the 
Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August 2021 resulted 
in displacement within the country as well as into 
neighbouring countries. The number of people 
displaced internally rose for the 15th straight year, even 
as more than 790,000 Afghans returned during the year.
The conflict in the Tigray region in Ethiopia  led to at 
least 2.5 million more people being displaced within 
their country, with some 1.5 million of them returning to 
their homes during the year. 
Violent insurgencies in the Central Sahel region 
of Africa continued to drive internal displacement, 
particularly in Burkina Faso.  The root causes of 
conflict in the region include extreme poverty and 
chronic underdevelopment. The climate crisis, with 
temperatures in the region rising 1.5 times faster 
than the global average, is making the humanitarian 
situation even worse.16
In Myanmar, the military takeover in February 2021 
ignited widespread violence and forced many 
people to flee. With renewed displacement from Venezuela, primarily 
to other Latin American countries, the number of 
Venezuelans displaced abroad also grew by more 
than half a million.
In addition, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic 
and Yemen all saw increases of between 100,000 and 
500,000 people displaced internally during the year.
While this report is focused on forced displacement 
in 2021, it is impossible to ignore more recent 
events in early 2022.  The war in Ukraine has 
captured global attention with, at the time of writing, 
more than 7 million Ukrainians displaced within their 
country and more than 6 million refugee movements 
from Ukraine having been registered.17 It is one of the 
largest forced displacement crises since World War II, 
and certainly the fastest. It should be remembered that 
refugees fleeing Ukraine are hosted by predominately 
high-income European countries. They have also 
been offered temporary protection status by European 
Union Member States, with more than 2.8 million

of the 36.2 million refugees, asylum seekers and 
others forced to flee across borders who were already 
displaced at the end of 2021 faced conditions that 
were much more dire.
As an example, people forced to flee are heavily 
impacted by food crises, with many refugees, asylum 
seekers and people displaced within their countries 
struggling to feed their families. In Afghanistan, for 
example, a staggering 55 per cent of the population 
in the country did not have enough to eat each day. 
Worldwide, 82 per cent of internally displaced people 
(IDPs) and 67 per cent of refugees and asylum seekers 
originated from countries with food crises in 2021.19 
Some 40 per cent of refugees and asylum seekers were 
hosted in countries with food crises at the end of 2021.
There is also a clear equity gap in the rollout of 
COVID-19 vaccinations. As of March 2022, only 1 per 
cent of the 10.9 billion administered doses worldwide 
have been given in low-income countries. This means 
that 2.8 billion people around the world are still 
waiting to get their first shot.20 Resources are therefore 
still needed for immunization-related activities and to 
ensure last-mile vaccine delivery. 
18 Source: UNHCR, Ukraine situation: Refugees from Ukraine across Europe  as of 29 May 2022
19 See: 2022 Global Report on Food Crises ; 82 per cent of IDPs (source IDMC) and 72 per cent of refugees under UNHCR’s mandate, people in

across borders are hosted in these same countries.

21 See IMF, War sets back the global recovery
22 See: Global Trends 2020
23 See 100 million forcibly displacedPrior to the war in Ukraine, the global economy 
was expected to recover to pre-pandemic growth 
rates between 2022 and 2024. Recent forecasts 
are more downbeat, primarily due to the resulting 
impact of inflationary pressures on food and fuel.21 
Low-income countries, hosting nearly a quarter of 
the world’s refugees, and more than two-thirds of 
people displaced within their countries are likely to 
be disproportionately affected. This will compound 
immediate and longer-term socio-economic 
challenges faced by displaced populations. 
In last year’s Global Trends report, UNHCR 
predicted that “the question is no longer if forced 
displacement will exceed 100 million people – but 
rather when”.22 The when is now.23 With millions of 
Ukrainians displaced at the time of writing, as well as 
further displacement elsewhere this year, notably in 
Burkina Faso and Myanmar, total forced displacement 
now exceeds 100 million people (see figure 1). This 
means 1 in every 78 people on earth has been forced 
to flee – a dramatic milestone that few would have 
expected a decade ago.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 1What next?
What direction is the world going to take in the years 
to come? The international community can take action, 
to redouble efforts to share responsibilities and find 
durable solutions, which could reverse the current 
trend, bringing displacement levels down significantly. 
The recent trend is concerning, as shown in figure 
2 below, with  the last decade quite different from 
the previous two decades. Historically, solutions for 
outflows from displacement situations have been 
available, but as new refugee situations intensify and existing ones reignite or remain unresolved, there is 
an acute and growing need for durable solutions at 
increasing scale. However, given the pace of new 
displacement over the last decade, solutions have 
struggled to keep up. In 2020, the impact of measures 
to limit the spread of COVID-19 was keenly observed 
in the sharp drops in all forms of durable solutions. The 
numbers of refugees and people displaced within their 
countries benefitting from solutions increased in 2021, 
but remain a small fraction of the overall needs.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 1If lasting peace were possible for current conflicts, 
how many refugees and IDPs would return? Return 
intention surveys, which UNHCR and its partners 
conduct in many countries globally, help indicate 
whether refugees wish to return to their countries 
of origin should the conditions allow. For example, 
some 7 in 10 Syrians hosted in mostly neighbouring 
countries hoped to return to Syria in the future.24 
More commonly, around one-third to one-half of other 
refugee populations have expressed a willingness to 
return in the future in similar surveys. If lasting peace 
were achieved in a few key locations, global refugee 
figures could halve to around 10 million, where they 
stood two decades ago. The most common reasons 
refugees tell us why return is not possible are ongoing 
insecurity and the lack of livelihoods or housing. But 
without the political will to make peace, the prospect 
for large numbers of refugees returning home in the 
near future will remain out of reach.
Other solutions include resettlement to third countries, 
a crucial tool for some of the most vulnerable 
refugees, who may face specific or urgent protection 
risks. However, the number of places for resettlement 
offered by States continues to fall far short of the 
global needs. In 2021, for example, just 4 per cent 
of the estimated 1.4 million refugees in need of 
resettlement were resettled.25
Naturalization is possible for refugees in some 
countries, including high-income countries in North 
America, Europe and Australasia. Administrative 
and bureaucratic hurdles, financial restraints and 
24 See: Sixth Regional Survey on Syrian Refugees’ Perceptions & Intentions on Return to Syria . Covering Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, the 
survey canvassed more than 3,200 Syrian refugees, out of a total of 1.9 million in these countries. The seventh return intention survey, which 
is soon to be published, shows that the number of Syrians intending to return is slightly lower.

Durable solutions have therefore become an option 
for fewer and fewer refugees and internally displaced 
people, and are far outpaced by the rising numbers 
of people forced to flee. As set out in the Global 
Compact on Refugees (GCR),27 enhancing refugee self-
reliance and easing the pressure on host countries 
needs to be stepped up while also redoubling efforts 
to expand durable solutions, especially in countries 
of origin. Finding durable solutions to displacement 
within countries is also critical, as underlined in the 
UN Secretary-General’s Action Agenda on Internal 
Displacement.28 
Greater international solidarity and responsibility-
sharing, two core principles underpinning the GCR, 
is urgently required. Otherwise, the 21st century risks 
being increasingly shaped by the growing number 
and intensity of conflicts and a consequent rise in the 
numbers of people forced to flee, further exacerbated 
by exposure to climate change. As the world reached 
in excess of 100 million forcibly displaced people, 
UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized 
“This is a political crisis, and it will only be solved 
with solidarity and political will.”.29 The international 
community must therefore work together now to 
resolve existing conflicts; to help address root causes 
to mitigate the risk of future conflicts unfolding in 
increasingly fragile states; and to deliver sustainable 
opportunities at the scale required to allow forcibly 
displaced people to live in safety and with dignity.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 1PREDICTING DISPLACEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns in its intermediate scenario that by the end of 
this century the average global temperature will increase by between 2.1 to 3.5 degrees centigrade 
compared to the pre-industrial era.30 Such a rise in temperature will have far-reaching implications on 
the earth’s ecosystems – and the people living within them. For example, rain-fed agriculture is likely 
to be particularly impacted and, worryingly, this currently forms the basis of the majority of people’s 
food security and livelihoods in Asia, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East 
and North Africa. 
Over the millennia, population movements have always been a strategy for coping with or escaping 
unsustainable or deteriorating environments. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimates 
that in 2021 alone, there were around 23.7 million displacements of people within their own countries 
by extreme weather events like floods, storms and droughts. The questions, though, of how many 
people will be uprooted by climate change in future years, and how their basic needs will be met, 
remain unanswered. The latest Groundswell report estimates that 216 million people could be forced 
to move within their countries by 2050 due to slow-onset events across six regions.31 Other scenarios 
have varied from 200 million to as many as 1 billion people displaced by climate change during the 
same period of time. 
But such figures should be treated carefully, as the nexus between climate change and human mobility 
is extremely complex. The impact of climate change on displacement is also not a uniform process and 
includes the following:
• Sudden-onset events  such as storms, floods and wildfires. The impact of sudden-onset events can 
be substantial in their immediate magnitude, but the people they displace usually remain nearby and 
seldom leave their country, with most returning within the first three months. There is little evidence 
so far that such events significantly shift the intermediate and long-term mobility behaviour of 
affected populations.
• Slow-onset events  such as droughts, changes in precipitation patterns, and salination from 
sea-level rises. Seasonal rural-urban migration is common among rural households, particularly in 
lower- and middle-income economies, as people cope with poor harvests and seek to diversify 
income sources. The negative impact of climate change on crop yields can lead to an increase in 
seasonal and even more permanent population movements. Such movements are currently most 
common between regions within the same countries. In many countries, though not all, seasonal 
migration is dominated by younger, better educated, typically male household members, which 
often leaves more vulnerable family members and women behind to cope with a deteriorating 
situation. For an increasing number of households, the impact of climate change on their income 
may compromise their ability to move elsewhere due to a lack of resources, trapping them in an 
unsustainable situation.
• Climate change related conflict.  Competition over diminishing land and water resources, 
movements to urban centres that strains their infrastructure, and rampant increases in global food 
prices that will hurt the urban population in low- and middle-income countries are the main factors 
heightening the risk of increased conflict. These risks are especially great in countries with weak 
governance and infrastructure and/or insufficient resources.
Any prediction of future displacement in the context of climate change is then faced with the following 
three challenges:
• In terms of the statistics relating to displacement in the context of climate change , simply put, what 
is not defined cannot be quantified, and what cannot be quantified cannot be predicted. The lack of 
30 See the Sixth IPCC report . 
31 See the Groundswell report .
10
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 1proper and commonly accepted statistics on displacement in the context of climate change currently 
creates one of the biggest hurdles for predictive work and makes it difficult to compare figures 
across studies. From a legal perspective, UNHCR does not support the term “climate refugee” which 
does not exist in international law: such a new legal category is not needed to provide relevant 
protection.32 It is also very difficult to assess whether someone who has been displaced in the 
context of climate change would have been displaced anyway had there been no climate change. 
• Secondly, the lack of historical precedent  for many situations that will arise as human-related climate 
change progresses, whose impact on human mobility has never been observed before. This means 
that it remains unclear how the changing climate will impact people’s decisions and behaviour in the 
future. Many communities affected by sudden-onset events have been hit by such events long 
before human induced climate change began and have learned to cope with them. For example, 
traditional Japanese architecture has been designed to accommodate frequent earthquakes. But an 
increased frequency and severity of sudden-onset events could bring these communities to the 
point where their traditional coping strategies are no longer up to the task. The effect might be a 
significant change in intermediate and long-term migratory behaviour.
• Finally, the link between climate change and (forced) displacement  remains not fully measurable 
and there is no consensus that it is a direct causal link, with, for example, only limited information 
available on the impact of climate change on mounting poverty, political instability and armed 
conflict. The current violence involving farmers and herders in northern Cameroon, for example, 
shows a distinctly causal relationship between climate change and conflict, although the wider 
empirical evidence for this relationship elsewhere is still sparse. Climate change can be the catalyst 
for conflict in situations where other preconditions for conflict and war are already in place.33
The task of producing reliable and accurate data of future displacement in the context of climate change 
is therefore clearly challenging. Rather than focusing on specific figures, what can be derived from the 
analyses to date is a fairly accurate depiction of the populations and areas that are at greatest risk due to 
climate change. Datasets such as the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which measures a country’s 
vulnerability to climate disruptions,34 provide useful baselines. In fact, some 95 per cent of all internal 
conflict displacements in 2021 occurred in countries that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change,35 and 78 per cent of new refugees36 and asylum seekers originate from these same countries. 
Over the last decade, more than four out of every five newly displaced refugees, asylum seekers and 
IDPs have originated from countries that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.37
Clearly, the best way to mitigate the risks of displacement in the context of climate change is concerted 
action to reduce global emissions and support for green, inclusive and resilient development as well as 
equitable use of resources. Without this action, it will be these most vulnerable populations that will 
most likely need the most support in the future, focused on in situ adaptation. Measures such as 
weather-resistant infrastructure, drought-resistant crop variants and farming techniques, irrigation, 
coastal-protection measures, and help for rural households to diversify their income sources away 
from the land can all contribute to minimizing the risk of displacement. 
32 Legal Considerations regarding claims for international protection made in the context of the adverse effects of climate change and disasters , 
UNHCR 2020
33 See Climate as a risk factor for armed conflict
34 A country’s vulnerability to climate change is determined from a combination of its exposure to climatic changes and its ability to cope with 
these changes given its financial and technical endowments. 
35 See ND-GAIN index . The 2021 figures are calculated using the 2019 ND-GAIN index, determining the percentage of new internal conflict 
displacements reported by IDMC or new refugees and asylum seekers under UNHCR’s mandate originating from the lowest 30 per cent of 
ND-GAIN index values, i.e., countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability data for South Sudan is not available, so 
Sudan is used as a proxy.
36 See the new forcibly displaced population flow dataset .
37 The correlation between a high ND-GAIN index and large numbers of forcibly displaced people does not imply that there is a causal relation 
between a high vulnerability to climate change and forced displacement. Rather compounding factors like poverty and weak institutions will 
both increase a country’s vulnerability to climate change and a country’s likelihood for conflict with subsequent large displacement numbers.

39 However, tracking data is available for Temporary Protection Status in Colombia. As of 31 December 2021, 1,696,399 people had been 
registered in the Registration System for Venezuelans (RUMV) and Migración Colombia had issued 39,618 Temporary Protection Permits. 
Data is publicly available and regularly updated on Estatuto Temporal de Protección .Over the span of the year, the number of refugees38 
worldwide increased from 20.7 in 2020 to 21.3 million 
at the end of 2021, more than double the 10.5 million 
a decade ago. The number of Venezuelans displaced 
abroad also rose, from 3.9 million to 4.4 million, 
during the same period. Throughout the year, 794,100 
people were granted international protection on an 
individual (494,900) or group (299,200) basis. While 
this is slightly more than in 2020 (765,200), it remains 
substantially below the pre-COVID-19 level of 952,800 
people in 2019. Many of the Venezuelans displaced abroad located in countries of Latin America and the 
Caribbean have been granted residence permits 
or other forms of legal stay during recent years, yet 
precise tracking data for these types of protection 
remain unavailable.39
In this chapter, the term “people displaced across 
borders” refers to refugees, people in refugee-like 
situations and Venezuelans displaced abroad, unless 
stated otherwise.

13 UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021Europe
In 2021, the number of people displaced across borders 
hosted in European countries increased by 3 per cent 
to more than 7 million. This increase reflects newly 
recognized refugees, who total 288,000, primarily in 
Germany (79,700), France (51,000) and Italy (21,100).
Türkiye remained the largest refugee-hosting country 
in the world in 2021, with more than 3.8 million 
refugees at year-end, or 15 per cent of all people 
displaced across borders globally. Germany was the 
second-largest refugee-hosting country in Europe, 
with 1.3 million refugees (5 per cent). 
Americas 
The Americas region hosted more than 5.1 million 
people displaced across borders (20 per cent 
of the global population), with 86 per cent being 
Venezuelans. Sharp growth in the number of 
Venezuelans displaced abroad accounted for much 
of the 11 per cent rise (524,000) across the Americas. 
The number of displaced Venezuelans in Peru, 
Colombia and Ecuador increased by 276,400, 112,900 
and 102,100 people respectively compared to the 
previous year as COVID-19-related travel restrictions 
eased in the region. At the same time, cross-border 
and pendular movements of Venezuelan refugees 
and migrants to and from their country also increased. 
Elsewhere in the region, significant numbers of 
refugees were recognized in Canada (33,800), Mexico 
(28,100) and the United States of America (20,600). 
At the end of 2021, Colombia hosted more than 1.8 
million people displaced across borders, while Peru 
hosted 797,300 and Ecuador 560,500.
Sub-Saharan Africa
As violence and conflict continued in parts of the 
continent, more than one quarter of all people 
displaced across borders were residing in sub-
Saharan Africa. The East and Horn of Africa and the 
Great Lakes region hosted more than 4.7 million 
refugees at the end of 2021, some 206,000 people, or 
5 per cent, more than in 2020. One fifth of all refugees 
worldwide are hosted in this region, predominately 
in only three countries: Uganda (1.5 million), Sudan 
(1.1 million) and Ethiopia (821,300). In 2021, 165,400 
40 This includes around 770,500 refugees and 27,800 UNHCR pre-registered new arrivals. Based on information received from the Government 
in October 2020, the Islamic Republic of Iran hosts 800,000 refugees, of which 780,000 are Afghan Amayesh cardholders and 20,000 are 
Iraqi Hoviat cardholders. These cards effectively offer refugee status to their holders. UNHCR has been in continuous engagement with 
the authorities in relation to these figures ever since. In view of the absence of updated data, UNHCR sought to estimate the changes in the 
refugee population considering the natural growth and onward movements, estimating the total to be some 770,000 refugees (out of which 
750,000 were Afghans and 20,000 Iraqis). refugees were recognized on an individual or group 
basis in the region, mostly in Sudan (66,300), Uganda 
(62,500) and Ethiopia (19,200).
Nearly 1.5 million refugees were hosted by countries 
in the West and Central Africa region, an increase of 
134,900 (10 per cent) compared to the end of 2020. 
Chad (555,800) and Cameroon (457,300) together 
hosted more than two-thirds (68 per cent) of them.
The number of refugees hosted within the Southern 
Africa region grew by 62,900 people to 783,300 in 
2021. More than half of the increase is attributed to 
the flight of refugees from the Central African Republic 
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, due to the 
violence and insecurity that followed the December 
2020 general election. The Democratic Republic of the 
Congo already hosted the largest refugee population in 
the region, reaching 524,100 refugees at year-end.
Asia and the Pacific
The number of refugees in the Asia and the Pacific 
region grew by 138,400 people in 2021, reaching 
4.2 million, or 16 per cent of the global refugee 
population, with Pakistan seeing the largest change. 
During the year, some 108,000 Afghans who fled to 
Pakistan were pre-screened by UNHCR. Meanwhile, 
a verification exercise is close to completion and 
has already led to a reduction of 383,900 registered 
Afghans as well as the registration of 198,600 births 
that occurred during the prior five years. A further 
129,700 Afghans are pending verification at the time of 
reporting. As a result, the total number of refugees in 
Pakistan increased slightly to just less than 1.5 million. 
After Pakistan, Bangladesh (918,900) and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran (798,300)40 hosted the largest refugee 
populations within the region.
Middle East and North Africa
The Middle East and North Africa region continues 
to see increases in refugee populations. Overall, the 
region recorded a slight decrease in the number 
between 2021 and the previous year refugees (3 per 
cent less) as a result of a refugee population review 
exercise ongoing in Yemen (83,300), data verification 
in Lebanon (32,200), as well as a relatively low number 
of refugees being newly recognized (33,000).

41 These models are generated using the available data for a country of origin as a starting point. Where data for a particular country of asylum 
is missing, the values are estimated using statistical modelling from the available data for the same origin country in nearby countries of 
asylum. Estimated demographic 
composition of people 
displaced across borders
UNHCR compiles data globally on the combined 
sex- and age-distribution of the populations of 
concern under its mandate at the end of each year. 
The availability of demographic data varies greatly 
by population group and by country of asylum. 
For example, demographic data by age and sex is 
available for 84 per cent of refugees and 42 per cent 
of Venezuelans displaced abroad at the end of 2021. 
Statistical modelling can be used to impute the sex- 
and age-distribution for missing demographic data 
for these populations, helping to fill these data gaps 
with estimates.41 Using this approach, 42 per cent of 
all refugees and Venezuelans displaced abroad at the 
end of 2021 are estimated to be children. This varies 
by region with children estimated to represent almost 55 per cent of these populations in sub-Saharan 
Africa. By comparison, 38 per cent of refugees in 
Europe and only 26 per cent in the Americas are 
estimated to be under the age of 18. 
Some 48 per cent of people displaced across borders 
are estimated to be women and girls. There are 
proportionally more women and girls among refugee 
populations living in West and Central Africa (54 per 
cent), while in Europe, this is estimated to be lower, at 
44 per cent.

43 In the Middle East and North Africa, the percentage of Syrian refugee children born in the region that were undocumented at birth (i.e. 
received neither a birth certificate nor a birth notification) reduced from 35 per cent in 2012 to 4 per cent in 2021.

BIRTH REGISTRATIONS
Data on births among refugee populations reported to UNHCR and registered by governments is 
incomplete and therefore undercount the number of children born into refugee status. To better 
assess the numbers of such children, UNHCR calculated estimates by imputing missing birth data 
for the years between 2018 to 2021. 42 The imputation had to accommodate the fact that forced 
displacement is likely to impact the fertility pattern of refugees. Refugees face a drastically different 
situation than those remaining in the country of origin and are usually not representative of the 
overall population. Thus, birth rates in the country of origin are not necessarily indicative of refugee 
populations that have fled these same countries. 
Between 2018 and 2021, there were gaps in the data on children born into refugee status in many 
countries globally. The biggest data gaps on birth figures are prevalent among refugee-hosting 
countries in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific and Europe regions. By contrast, in the Middle East 
and North Africa, birth registration of Syrian refugee children has progressively improved since the 
onset of the crisis.43
UNHCR estimates that more than 1.5 million children were born into refugee life between 2018 and 
2021, equivalent to some 380,000 children per year. Registration figures for 2020 were 
compromised by movement restrictions implemented by States to halt the spread of COVID-19, 
which made it much more difficult to conduct civil registration activities, but they have recovered in 
2021. Considering that this imputation is based on several broad statistical assumptions, results 
should be interpreted as estimates and not precise figures. UNHCR, through its involvement in 
IDAC,44 is leading efforts to improve data on displaced children.
16
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 2By country of origin
Around 83 per cent of people displaced across 
borders originate from just ten countries, in line with 
previous years (see figure 5). 
The Syrian refugee population continues to be the 
largest globally, with 6.8 million refugees hosted in 
129 countries. Syrian refugees constituted 27 per 
cent of the global refugee population at the end of 
2021. In the course of the year, the number of Syrian 
refugees increased by 145,900, due to new births and 
a rise in individual recognitions in Germany (38,100), 
Austria (7,900) and other countries in Europe. Even so, 
and after more than a decade of conflict, more than 
three-quarters of Syrian refugees are still hosted by 
neighbouring countries, mostly in Türkiye (3.7 million), 
Lebanon (840,900) and Jordan (673,000). Germany 
is the largest non-neighbouring host country, with 
621,700 Syrian refugees.
Venezuelans are the second-largest population 
displaced across borders, with 4.6 million. Nearly all 
are located in the Americas region without formal 
refugee status. In 2021, their population grew by more 
than 570,000, due to newly displaced Venezuelans 
fleeing to Colombia (112,900), Ecuador (102,100) as well 
as an improved estimation of displaced Venezuelans 
in Peru (276,400) and Chile (45,700). Afghans represent the third-largest refugee population 
globally, with more than 2.7 million hosted by 98 
countries. Their numbers grew by almost five per 
cent (118,000) in 2021, driven by new outflows to 
neighbouring Pakistan (108,000) and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran (27,800), newly registered births and 
new recognitions in Europe (59,100) and Asia and the 
Pacific (6,000).
The number of South Sudanese refugees increased 
from 2.2 million in 2020 to 2.4 million at the end of 
2021. Almost all are hosted by four neighbouring 
countries: Uganda (958,900), Sudan (803,600), 
Ethiopia (386,800) and Kenya (135,300). Most of the 
109,900 newly recognized South Sudanese refugees 
were recognized by prima facie procedures in Sudan 
(63,900), Uganda (30,600) and Kenya (9,000).
Following the sizeable displacement of Rohingya 
refugees from Myanmar in 2017, this population 
remains one of the largest displaced groups globally. 
In 2021, its number increased by some 73,800 people 
to reach 1.2 million, with more than three-quarters 
hosted in Bangladesh. The increase in 2021 was 
primarily due to the registration of new births, including 
the backlog from 2020, as registration resumed in 
2021 after being suspended due to COVID-19.

The proportion of a country’s population who become refugees – SDG indicator 
10.7.4 – is a useful way to identify the countries of origin whose population 
displaced abroad is highest relative to its inhabitants.45 As shown in figure 6, the 
countries that have seen the greatest proportion of their national population 
become refugees are Syria (27,300 per 100,000 inhabitants), South Sudan 
(17,200 per 100,000) and Venezuela (13,800 per 100,000).

45 See UN Statistical Commission 51st session (2020) documents . Indicator 10.7.4 is computed as follows: [Number of refugees by country of 
origin at end-year / (End-year population in country of origin + number of refugees by country of origin at end-year)] * 100,000. For this report, 
refugees and Venezuelans displaced abroad have been included. The indicator excludes Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate.By country of asylum
Türkiye, Colombia and Uganda remained the three 
largest hosting countries for those displaced across 
borders (see figure 7). The refugee population in 
Türkiye, almost all of whom are Syrians, grew to 3.8 
million people in 2021. In Colombia, the number of people displaced across borders rose to 1.8 million, as 
an additional 113,000 Venezuelans sought refuge in 
the country during the year. Uganda hosted the third-
largest number of refugees, with 1.5 million at the end 
of 2021, mostly from South Sudan (63 per cent) and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (29 per cent).

72 per cent hosted by 
neighbouring countriesMost people fleeing conflict and persecution prefer to remain near their 
country of origin. In 2021 nearly three-quarters of people displaced 
across borders were hosted in neighbouring countries.
83 per cent are hosted by 
low- and middle-income 
countriesLow-income countries continue to host a disproportionately large 
share of the global displaced population. According to the World Bank 
income classification for 2021,46 low-income countries host 22 per cent 
of people displaced across borders. This includes very large refugee 
populations in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Chad and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. A further 21 per cent were hosted by lower-
middle-income countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Upper-middle-income countries – including Türkiye, 
Colombia, Lebanon and Jordan – hosted 40 per cent of people 
displaced across borders. High-income countries, which account for 
most of the global wealth,47 hosted only 16 per cent of people displaced 
across borders.
27 per cent are hosted 
by the Least Developed 
Countries48The Least Developed Countries consist of 46 countries, including 
Bangladesh, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, 
Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, the United Republic of 
Tanzania, and Yemen. Together, they account for less than 1.3 per cent 
of the global Gross Domestic Product,49 yet they were responsible for 
hosting more than 27 per cent of all people displaced across borders 
worldwide. At the end of 2021, the number of refugees in the Least 
Developed Countries stood at 7 million.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 2HOW LONG DO REFUGEES REMAIN DISPLACED IN PROTRACTED SITUATIONS?
Protracted refugee situations 
Protracted refugee situations are defined as those where more than 25,000 refugees from the same 
country of origin have been in exile in a given low- or middle-income host country for at least five 
consecutive years.50 This definition should be seen as a reflection of the refugee situation as a whole 
and does not refer to circumstances of individual refugees (see new research below).
At the end of 2021, an estimated 15.9 million refugees (74 per cent of the global refugee population) 
were in a protracted situation. This represented an increase of more than 203,000 refugees compared 
to the previous year. There were a total of 51 protracted situations in 31 different host countries. Some of 
the protracted situations are relatively recent, such as the ongoing displacement of refugees from the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in Zambia, while others such as Burundian refugees in the United 
Republic of Tanzania have been in prolonged displacement for decades. 
Estimating the duration refugees in protracted situations live in a given country
In new research, UNHCR has estimated the probability of individual refugees remaining displaced over 
time using the data it maintains in its case management system, known as proGres. UNHCR is 
responsible for registering refugees in 81 countries, totalling some 8.1 million refugees, more than 
one-third of the global refugee population. The research is focused on selected protracted situations.
For some refugee situations, only a limited amount of registration data is available. Also, circumstances 
that influence refugees’ likelihood to remain displaced vary significantly based on their country of origin, 
and in which country of asylum they are hosted. For example, the opportunity to naturalize as a root to 
bringing refugee status to an end is not broadly available. Equally, opportunities for refugees to return to 
their home countries are not available to all of them and depend on a variety of factors. UNHCR has 
analysed nine protracted situations of varying durations, as shown in Figure 8, using the available events 
in its case management data to calculate the duration for which a refugee has remained displaced.51
The probability in these situations of someone remaining a refugee for at least five years – i.e. the minimum 
duration that UNHCR defines as protracted – varies between 63 and 99 per cent (see figure 8).52 
Furthermore, the duration of each protracted situation varies, and the probability that someone remains a 
refugee for the entire duration of their situation decreases to anywhere from 96 to zero per cent. This 
likelihood varies considerably by situation: it is 96 per cent for South Sudanese in Sudan; 88 per cent for 
Rohingya in Bangladesh; 62 per cent for people from the Central African Republic in Cameroon; between 
42 and 46 per cent for Syrians in Jordan, Iraq and Egypt; 26 per cent for Somalis in Kenya; and zero per 
cent for Burundians in the United Republic of Tanzania. Multiple factors influence these estimates – most 
notably returns, onwards movements and the opportunity to naturalize in refugees’ host countries. 
What is clear already from the research is that while the protracted situation designation is useful to 
summarize these situations, the categorization is not reflective of individual refugees’ conditions, with 
individual refugees tending to be displaced for shorter durations, albeit with significant variation 
between situations. The years spent by refugees in displacement could reduce in the future if the 
international community as a whole contributed resources and expertise to support countries of origin, 
upon their request, to address root causes, to remove obstacles to return, and to enable conditions 
favourable to voluntary repatriation.
50 Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate are excluded from this analysis. 
51 The refugee duration is calculated by comparing the registration date with the end of 2021 for active and ‘on hold’ cases, and the process 
status date for those cases that are closed or inactive. Cases on hold are those where UNHCR has not been able to contact the refugee, 
typically for three months. Closed and inactive cases are assumed to no longer be refugees, typically due to death, return or onwards 
movements. Biometric registration helps to ensure that individual cases are not duplicated should an individual be reactivated in the same 
country, or another country where UNHCR undertakes registration.
52 Kaplan-Meier plots are used in this research to show the probability of a refugee remaining displaced for a given number of years. The 
probability will always decrease over time to a greater or lesser extent depending on a range of context specific factors, as well as mortality. 
For example, some 66 per cent of Syrians in Jordan are likely to remain displaced after five years, with the likelihood decreasing to 58 per 
cent after 10 years. This is more useful than a simple median or mean length of displacement, as these are skewed by the fact that most 
refugees remained displaced at the end of 2021.

People (IDPs)
Key global developments in 2021
53 Source: Internal Displacement Monitoring CentrePeople displaced inside their own countries due 
to armed conflicts, generalized violence or human 
rights violations continue to constitute the majority 
of the forcibly displaced population globally. Known 
as internally displaced people, or IDPs, they account 
for some 60 per cent of all people displaced.53 By 
year-end, UNHCR reported on situations of internal displacement in 35 countries, and all the following 
figures in this chapter relate to IDPs of concern to 
UNHCR, unless otherwise indicated. Worldwide, the 
IDP population has increased during nine of the last 
ten years, rising nearly three-fold from 17.7 million in 
2012 to 51.3 million in 2021 – once again the highest 
level ever recorded.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021 23Data on IDPs reported by UNHCR includes only 
those internally displaced due to conflict and 
violence. In addition, there were 23.7 million internal 
displacements in the context of disasters and due to 
the impacts of climate change during the year, with 
5.9 million people remaining displaced at end-year, 
according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre (IDMC). 
54 See Joint Investigation into Alleged Violations of International Human Rights, Humanitarian and Refugee Law Committed by all Parties
55 See Sahel internal displacement tops 2 million as violence surgesChanges by regions and 
countries
Internal displacement increased in nearly all regions 
globally, driven by ongoing or escalating violence and 
conflicts (see Figure 10). More than three-quarters of all 
new internal displacements in 2021 occurred in Sub-
Saharan Africa, consistent with recent years.

Millions
The largest numbers of people newly displaced 
within their countries in 2021 were observed in the 
East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes region, 
with nearly 4.1 million recorded in Ethiopia, Somalia, 
South Sudan and Sudan. The surge in numbers in 
Ethiopia was largely driven by the crisis in the north 
of the country. In late 2020, fighting in the Tigray 
region broke out between the federal government 
and the former regional government of Tigray, spilling 
over into the neighbouring regions of Amhara and 
Afar. The ongoing conflict, which made headlines 
for widespread violations of rights, including sexual 
violence, led to at least a further 2.5 million people 
being displaced within the country in 2021. A 
joint investigation by the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commission and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that 
forced displacement could “amount to crimes against 
humanity and war crimes”, with all parties to the 
conflict implicated.54 
In South Sudan, an insurgency in the Equatoria region, 
and increasingly lethal intercommunal violence, 
worsened by widespread presence of weapons, continued to trigger displacement. An estimated 
528,900 people fled their homes during the year, 
bringing the total number of conflict-related IDPs 
in South Sudan to about two million. Its neighbour 
Sudan also witnessed more than half a million people 
(543,300) newly displaced within the country, primarily 
attributed to ongoing intercommunal conflict and 
violence that followed the military coup in October 
2021. The number of IDPs in Sudan stood at more than 
3 million at the end of the year. More than half a million 
people were also displaced in Somalia (544,200), with 
most estimated to have returned during the year. 
In the West and Central Africa region, there were 1.6 
million new displacements in 2021. These increased 
movements were mainly driven by escalating conflict 
in Burkina Faso and Nigeria, where fighting continued 
between government forces and non-state armed 
groups. In Nigeria, displacement has been growing 
rapidly since 2018, with 500,700 people newly 
displaced during 2021. The internal displacement 
crisis in Burkina Faso is one of the fastest growing 
in the world.55 Until 2017, Burkina Faso was mostly 
spared from the violence that drove displacement 
24
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 3in many neighbouring countries. But the internally 
displaced population has since then grown many 
times over, rising from less than 50,000 at the start of 
2018 to around 1.6 million four years later – including 
507,600 new displacements during 2021. The Central 
African Republic also saw 392,800 people newly 
displaced within the country during the year, triggered 
largely by the violence and insecurity that followed 
the December 2020 general election. Most were 
able to return to their homes during 2021. In Mali and 
Chad, respectively, some 98,100 and 70,400 new 
displacements were recorded during the year. Chronic 
underdevelopment, economic inequality, and other 
socio-economic factors are among the root causes of 
conflicts in West and Central Africa. Addressing these 
underlying issues remains critical to stemming the 
growing internal displacement crisis in the region. 
In the Southern Africa region, 1.5 million people were 
newly displaced within the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo and a further 76,900 in Mozambique. 
While many IDPs in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo returned during the year, both countries 
saw substantial growth in their internally displaced 
populations at year-end (up 4% and 12% respectively).
Almost 1.4 million people were reported to be newly 
displaced in the Asia and Pacific region, stemming almost 
entirely from humanitarian crises in Afghanistan and 
Myanmar. In Afghanistan, 777,400 new displacements 
due to conflict were reported.56 For over four decades, 
Afghanistan experienced successive conflicts which 
forced millions to flee their homes. The latest conflict 
ran for 20 years and mainly pitted government and 
foreign forces against the Taliban; it ended with the 
latter’s takeover of Kabul in August 2021. The events 
leading up to Kabul’s takeover resulted in further massive 
displacement, with many subsequently returning during 
the year. In Myanmar, the military takeover in February 
2021 ignited widespread violence, including the heavy 
use of explosives and weapons in and around populated 
areas, leading to 433,000 new displacements. By year-
end, the total number of IDPs had reached 671,000.

58 See: Increased Syria violence prompts largest civilian displacements in a year, as gridlock stymies political talks
59 This excludes internal displacement in 2022, which is estimated at 7 million at the time of writing (Source: IOM).
60 The National Victims Registry of Colombia contains the historical accumulated figure of the number of victims of displacement, which 
continues to increase given that victims continue to be registered in the country. Thus, the total number of people recognized as victims of 
displacement (more than 8.2 million), includes the number of IDPs who are subject to attention and/or reparation, i.e. those who meet the 
requirements to access the measures of attention and reparation established in Colombian Law 1448 (6.8 million). The number of victims 
of displacement who are deceased, or IDPs who were victims of homicide or forced disappearance, and other victims who, for various 
reasons, cannot effectively access these measures, are identified as not being subject to attention or reparation and therefore not included 
in the figure of 6.8 million. The figure is constantly updated, considering that by legal definition, victims have up to two years to make their 
declaration and be included in the registry system. See the summary on the Victims Unit website .Millions of IDPs have remained displaced for years in 
the Middle East and North Africa. Evolving situations 
have led to new displacements in 2021, notably in 
Yemen (286,700) and Syria (237,600). The increase in 
Yemen is primarily attributed to what was described 
as “among the worst” escalation of the conflict seen in 
recent years.57 In Syria, new displacement continued 
in 2021 due to instability.58 Conversely, return activities 
following the ceasefire agreement in Libya in late 
2020, led to a 36 per cent decrease in the overall 
IDP population to 179,000 by the end of the year. 
While the ceasefire has allowed many IDPs to return 
to their places of origin, returnees are confronted 
with numerous challenges, including limited access to 
services, contamination from explosive devices such 
as landmines and unexploded ordnance.
In the Americas, a further 124,000 people were displaced 
within Colombia. In Europe, no IDPs were newly 
displaced in 2021. However, an improvement in the 
estimation of people displaced in government-controlled 
areas in Ukraine led to an increase in the overall IDP 
population, which stood at 854,000 at year-end.59
Internal displacement overview
At the end of 2021, Syria, Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Ethiopia and Afghanistan 
continued to host the largest IDP populations globally 
(see figure 11). In Syria, more than 10 years of conflict 
have forced millions to flee within the country, and at 
the end of 2021 an estimated 6.9 million people were 
still internally displaced. This means that more than 1 in 
3 Syrians remaining within the country were internally 
displaced at the end of 2021.
In Colombia, further to a revision of IDP figures in 
consultation with the Government, 6.8 million IDPs 
were still in need of humanitarian assistance and 
solutions at the end of the year.60 This includes 
124,000 new internally displaced people that were 
registered during the year. 
25
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 3The Democratic Republic of the Congo hosts the third-
largest IDP population worldwide and the largest one 
on the African continent. At end-2021, the number of 
IDPs there reached 5.4 million. In Yemen, more than 
4.3 million people remained internally displaced at 
the end of 2021, an increase of 7 per cent compared 
to the previous year. The number of IDPs in Ethiopia 
61 Given that disaggregation of urban and rural locations was only available for 44 per cent of IDP data, the actual percentage is likely to be higher.and Afghanistan also rose substantially during 2021. 
Internal displacement in Ethiopia has been growing 
rapidly, tripling in less than 4 years from 1.1 million to 
over 3.6 million. In Afghanistan, the total number of 
IDPs reached an estimated 3.5 million at end-2021, 
continuing an uninterrupted 15-year rising trend.

Demographics of IDPs
UNHCR continuously aims to improve its collection 
of age-, sex- and location-disaggregated data of 
internally displaced. In 2021, sub-national location 
data for IDPs was available for 23 of the 35 countries 
where UNHCR collates IDP data; age- and sex-
disaggregation was available in 13 countries; and sex-
disaggregation was available in a further 6 countries. 
In instances where location data was available, 48 per 
cent of IDPs lived in urban areas.61 Women and girls 
accounted for 50 per cent of the internally displaced 
population in 2021, in line with previous years. There 
are, however, notable differences between countries. 
In the Central African Republic, six out of ten IDPs 
were female, and in Niger, Mali and Honduras there 
were at least 10 per cent more female IDPs than male. 
In contrast, in Sudan, 54 per cent of people displaced 
within their country were male. 
Some 45 per cent of people displaced within 
their countries were children, who are particularly 
vulnerable in contexts of displacement. The proportion 
of IDPs who were children also varied widely between 
settings. For example, in Niger, Burkina Faso, Somalia, Afghanistan and Yemen children constituted 
a substantially larger share of the IDP population 
than adult IDPs. In contrast, in Colombia, children 
accounted for just 23 per cent of the IDP population.
IDP returns
When suitable conditions are in place, the return of 
internally displaced people to their place of origin 
is widely seen as a desirable outcome, reflecting 
a durable solution for IDPs. In 2019, IDP returns 
totalled more than 5.3 million. Then, as the COVID-19 
pandemic set in, they dropped significantly, to 3.2 
million in 2020. In 2021, IDP returns increased to reach 
pre-pandemic levels, with an estimated 5.3 million 
people returning during the year. 
Returns, however, varied substantially among 
countries. Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, Iraq and South Sudan all saw significant 
reductions in IDP returns, while more IDPs were able 
to return in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, 
Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Somalia. The increase 
in the return of IDPs in Afghanistan is attributed to a 
significant reduction of hostilities following the Taliban 
26
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 3takeover. In the Central African Republic, the recapture 
of territories from non-state armed groups prompted 
the return of IDPs.62 In Myanmar IDPs returned in 2021, 
as fighting subsided.63 
Demographic data collected in 2021 on IDP returnees 
improved, with coverage by age and sex improving from 
9 per cent last year to 26 per cent. This was notably 
due to the inclusion of demographics for this population 
group from Afghanistan. Overall, based on the available 
demographic data, the proportion of men and women 
among returnees is balanced and children represent the 
majority of IDP returnees, accounting for 58 per cent.
Displacement in the context of 
climate change and disasters
According to IDMC figures, in 2021 there were 
23.7 million new internal displacements globally 
due to disasters (these are in addition to those 
internally displaced due to conflict and violence). 
This represented a decrease of seven million, or 
23 per cent, compared to the previous year. The 
largest displacements in the context of disasters in 
2021 occurred in China (6.0 million), the Philippines 
(5.7 million) and India (4.9 million). Most disaster 
displacements during the year were temporary,

displaced at the end of the year due to disasters. 
As part of its implementation of the Strategic Framework 
on Climate Action64 and commitment to improve the 
protection of IDPs, UNHCR developed a Practical 
Guidance on IDP Protection in the Context of Disasters 
and the Adverse Effects of Climate Change.65 
Protecting IDPs
UNHCR continues to promote the protection of 
IDPs – including by supporting the development of 
normative frameworks through technical assistance, 
advocacy and capacity building. In 2021, UNHCR 
supported the development of national laws and 
policies across several countries including Ukraine, 
Mozambique and Nigeria. In August, the Government 
of Mozambique adopted an IDP policy and strategy, 
while Nigeria adopted a law specific to the protection 
of IDPs in September. In late 2021, Ukraine adopted 
an IDP Inclusion and Durable Solutions Strategy 
and Operational Plan. UNHCR continues to support 
normative developments, notably in Burkina Faso, 
Chad, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 3Asylum trends
66 The data for some countries may include a significant number of repeat claims, i.e. the applicant has submitted at least one previous 
application in the same or another country.
67 Statistical information on outcomes of asylum appeals and court proceedings is underreported in UNHCR’s statistics, particularly in high-
income countries, because this type of data is often either not collected by States or not published.Refugee Status Determination (RSD) is the process by 
which governments or UNHCR determine whether an 
individual seeking international protection is a refugee 
under national, regional or international law. A strong 
refugee status determination system, which fairly and 
efficiently processes asylum applications, is a crucial 
step in ensuring that refugees receive protection, that 
public confidence in the asylum system is maintained 
and that long-lasting solutions for refugees are realized.
Refugee status can be granted individually or on a 
group basis. Group recognition most commonly takes 
place when there are readily apparent, objective 
circumstances in a country of origin which suggest 
that the majority of individuals fleeing from that country 
are likely to be refugees. In most cases, individuals 
being granted refugee status on a group basis will 
be directly registered as refugees, as opposed to an 
individual recognition where an individual will first be 
registered as an asylum seeker. This is why individuals 
undergoing group determination will normally not be 
counted in the “asylum application” total.
In 2021, States and UNHCR collectively registered 
some 1.7 million individual asylum applications in 155 
countries, 35 per cent more than in 2020 (1.3 million). 
However, the overall number of applications remains 
well below pre-COVID-19 levels (for example: 2.2 
million in 2019 and 2.1 million in 2018). The overall 
increase in 2021 from the previous year includes large 
increases in asylum applications in Germany, Mexico, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Costa Rica, 
but also significant decreases in Brazil, Peru, Spain 
and the United States of America.An estimated 81 per cent of individual asylum 
applicants were registered at first instance66 (that is, 
by the initial administrative or judicial authority), and 
the remainder at the second instance, such as upon 
review by courts or other appellate bodies.67 In 2021, 
repeat and appeal applications increased at a greater 
rate than first-instance applications, suggesting that 
COVID-19-related restrictions still had an impact on 
access to asylum and territory during the year, as 
individuals making repeat and appeal applications 
would already be in the asylum country.
During the year, over one million individuals received 
a decision on their individual refugee claim, slightly 
more than in 2020. Some 494,900 people received 
refugee or other protection status in 149 countries, 
while 519,200 were rejected. Compared to the 
previous year, there were 8 per cent more positive 
decisions, and 5 per cent fewer rejections. In addition, 
some 299,200 individuals received an international 
protection status through group procedures, slightly 
fewer than in 2020 (305,500).
In 2021, 27,000 unaccompanied or separated children 
(UASC) lodged new asylum applications, accounting 
for two per cent of new asylum claims. This represents 
an increase of 6,000 applications compared to the 
previous year and also surpasses pre-pandemic 
levels. Yet figures for asylum applications by UASC 
remain significant underestimates due to the limited 
number of countries reporting data on UASC.CHAPTER 4+EXPLORE

Individual asylum applications 
registered
In 2021, the number of new individual asylum 
applications registered globally increased by 25 per 
cent, from 1.1 million to 1.4 million, compared with the 
previous year, although this remains lower than the 
1.7 million and 2.0 million applications in 2018 and 
2019 respectively. Given the numerous new and 
existing displacement situations, the lower number 
of new asylum applications reflects continued travel 
restrictions and barriers relating to access to territory 
that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, despite adaptive measures that have been put in place. Some 
81,700 new applications were made via UNHCR-
mandate RSD procedures, 700 via joint UNHCR/
State RSD procedures and 1.3 million via national RSD 
procedures.
The number of individual asylum applications received 
globally at appeal or other instances (including 
reopening and judicial review) grew by 63 per cent, 
from 196,800 in 2020 to 320,000 in 2021.
By country of asylum
Of the 1.4 million new individual asylum applications, 
66 per cent or 919,800 people were received in just 
ten countries (see figure 13). While there were fewer

In the United States of America, more than half of all 
new applications in 2021 were lodged by nationals of 
just five countries: Venezuela (27,000 or 14 per cent); 
Guatemala (23,000 or 12 per cent); Honduras (19,600 
or 10 per cent); El Salvador (14,900 or 8 per cent); and 
Cuba (12,900 or 7 per cent). 
In Germany, nearly two-thirds of new applications 
were by nationals of Syria (54,900), Afghanistan 
(23,300) and Iraq (15,600). Mexico received the third-
largest number of new asylum applications (131,400), 
which increased more than three-fold from 41,200 in 
2020. More than two-thirds of them originated from 
Haiti (51,800, or 39 per cent) and Honduras (36,400, 
or 28 per cent).By country of origin
In 2021, new asylum applications were most commonly 
registered by nationals of Nicaragua (up 92,700 
or a five-fold increase from 2020), Afghanistan (up 
49,300 or 65 per cent) and Syria (up 37,600 or 52 per 
cent). Nicaraguans fled the growing socio-political 
crisis and increasing political persecution in their 
country. The number of new asylum claims from 
Venezuelans dropped by 64,500, or 41 per cent. 
While this decrease is noteworthy, it does not indicate 
a decrease in Venezuelans leaving their country 
and seeking international protection. As discussed 
in chapter 2, depending on the options available to 
them, many Venezuelans regularize their stay in third 
countries through other, non-asylum mechanisms.

70 Unlike a State, which has the power to grant legal status in its territory after an RSD decision, such decisions under UNHCR’s mandate may 
not have a protection impact for the individual involved, depending on the specific context.Figure 14 | Major source countries of new asylum applications | 2021

By asylum authority 
UNHCR registered asylum applications for RSD under 
its mandate in 47 countries in 2021, primarily in the 
Middle East and North Africa as well as in Asia and 
the Pacific, three countries fewer than in 2020. Where 
possible, UNHCR supports States taking on their 
responsibilities for RSD, and therefore the number of 
States where UNHCR conducts mandate RSD should 
decrease over time. However, the reduction between 
2020 and 2021 was due to locations that did not 
receive any applications throughout the year.
Since 2015, UNHCR has implemented a strategic 
direction on RSD,69 which guides RSD that UNHCR 
undertakes within its mandate. Given that RSD can 
be a resource-intensive activity, UNHCR focuses its 
RSD activities on situations where there is likely to be 
a substantive protection impact (e.g. at the individual, 
case or operational levels).70 In 2021, UNHCR 
improved the recording of statistics relating to those 
asylum seekers who do not require RSD, with 9,400 
of them arriving during the year. This compares with 
81,700 new asylum applications that did require RSD in 2021, an increase from the 50,300 in 2020, principally 
in Malaysia, Libya, Egypt and India.
Group determination of 
refugee status
Slightly fewer people received international protection 
through group determination procedures in 2021 
than during the previous year: 299,200 compared to 
305,500. As in past years, most group recognitions 
occurred in Africa, as many African countries have 
a well-adapted legislative framework that provides 
for efficient group recognition in appropriate 
circumstances. These group recognitions notably 
took place in Chad (71,000), Sudan (64,500), Uganda 
(42,900), Cameroon (28,200), Ethiopia (19,100) and 
Niger (16,100).

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 4Decisions on asylum 
applications 
Some 1.4 million decisions were processed by States 
and UNHCR at all levels of procedures in 2021, of 
which about one million were substantive decisions,71 
and the rest were administrative closures.72 While this 
overall number was comparable with 2020, specific 
countries dramatically increased or decreased their 
decision-making output as operational priorities 
shifted under COVID-19, backlog reduction exercises 
commenced or ended.
The Total Protection Rate, or TPR, is the percentage 
of substantive decisions that resulted in any form of 
international protection. Worldwide, this figure stood at 
49 per cent in 2021, consistent with recent years.73
The overall number of decisions made by UNHCR 
under its mandate declined from 70,700 in 202074 to 
52,800 in 2021. Among these, 25,000 (48 per cent) 
were substantive decisions, a decline of 31 per cent 
from the 36,100 during the previous year. As was 
reported in the 2021 Mid-Year Trends report,75 the 
reason for this decrease in substantive decisions 
was largely due to COVID-19 and the impact it had 
on operations. In the initial stages of COVID-19 in 
2020, many UNHCR operations were unable to 
effectively interview individuals for refugee status 
during lockdowns, as adaptive measures took some 
time to put in place. As a result, many of these 
operations focused decision-making on the cases of 
asylum seekers who had already been interviewed. 
Notable in this respect was Egypt, where UNHCR 
made a significant number of substantive decisions in 
2020 while interviewing was suspended. In 2021, by 
71 Substantive decisions include Convention status, complementary and other forms of protection, and rejected cases.
72 These are the closure of a case without a decision on the merits. For example, from the death of the applicant, no-show for interview, 
withdrawal of the application, abandonment of the claim, or the determination that another country is responsible for the claim, among other 
factors.
73 UNHCR uses two rates to compute the proportion of refugee claims accepted. The Refugee Recognition Rate is the proportion of asylum 
seekers accorded refugee status out of the total number of substantive decisions (Convention status, complementary protection and rejected 
cases). The Total Protection Rate is the proportion of asylum seekers accorded refugee status or a complementary form of protection relative 
to the total number of substantive decisions. Non-substantive decisions are, to the extent possible, excluded from both calculations. For the 
purposes of global comparability, UNHCR uses only these two rates and does not report rates calculated by national authorities.
74 This is 45,100 fewer than reported in Global Trends 2020 due to a correction in the number of administrative closures for Iraqis and Yemenis 
in Jordan.
75 See UNHCR 2021 Mid-year trendscontrast, UNHCR conducted more interviews in Egypt 
but made fewer substantive decisions. In relation to 
administrative closures, these vary from year to year 
based on when data clean-up exercises take place, 
among other issues. 
Pending asylum claims
The number of asylum seekers waiting for a decision 
at the end of 2021 stood at 4.6 million, significantly 
more than at the end of 2020 (4.2 million). This 
increase emphasizes the need for States and UNHCR 
to ensure effective ways of processing asylum claims, 
including by focusing on strong data management, 
triaging cases and implementing differentiated RSD 
processing modalities. A growing backlog can create 
protection concerns if asylum seekers wait many 
years without legal certainty, and it is more difficult for 
rejected applicants to return to their country of origin.
In 2021, Canada, Ecuador, France and Greece were 
able to significantly reduce their backlog of pending 
cases. In Ecuador, the backlog was reduced by 73 per 
cent (from 26,000 in 2020 to 7,100 in 2021), in Greece 
by 40 per cent (from 60,900 to 37,100), in France by 
36 per cent (from 118,200 to 75,700) and in Canada 
by 26 per cent (from 85,400 to 63,200). Conversely, 
the backlog increased in 95 countries during the year. 
Increases were greatest in Mexico (up 88 per cent, 
from 83,800 to 157,200), Costa Rica (up 70 per cent, 
from 89,800 to 152,500), and the United States of 
America (up 31 per cent, from 998,000 to 1,303,200).Map 4 | Asylum seekers (with pending cases) | end-2021

77 See the IDP chapter for an update on solutions for IDPs.
78 Naturalization is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country.
79 See 2021 Burundi JRRRPAs new refugee situations emerge and intensify, and 
existing ones reignite or remain unresolved, there 
is an acute need for durable solutions at increasing 
scale. The Global Compact on Refugees76 notes that 
one strategic priority for UNHCR and the humanitarian 
community is to identify and support durable solutions 
that enable refugees to rebuild their lives and live in 
safety and dignity.
This chapter focuses primarily on durable solutions 
for refugees.77 Durable solutions traditionally 
include voluntary repatriation, local integration and 
resettlement to a third country. While the number of 
refugees returning or naturalizing78 has risen in 2021 
and returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, resettlement 
remains well below this, albeit higher than in 2020.
Return 
For most refugees, returning to their home country 
based on a free and informed choice would be a 
preferred solution to bring their temporary status as 
refugees to an end. To realize this, political stability 
and economic opportunities are essential to ensure 
that the environment refugees face upon their return 
allows them to reintegrate in safety and with dignity. To 
ensure that the returns are sustainable, UNHCR, the 
country of origin and the international community all 
strive to achieve these enabling conditions.Voluntary repatriation surged by 71 per cent in 2021, 
with 429,300 refugees returning to their countries of 
origin. As a result, in 2021, returns are comparable with 
recent pre-pandemic years. 
Nearly two-thirds of refugee returns in 2021 were 
to South Sudan, totalling 270,200, even as the dire 
humanitarian situation in the country drove further forced 
displacement. South Sudanese refugees were mostly 
returning from Uganda (180,400), Sudan (44,200) and 
Ethiopia (28,200). Returns to South Sudan are difficult to 
verify, however, as they tend to be self-organized, and 
access is often constrained in areas of returns.
As part of the Joint Refugee Return and Reintegration 
Plan, the Burundian authorities, UNHCR, the UN 
Development Programme and other partners support 
the sustainable return of refugees to Burundi.79 Returns 
to Burundi began in 2020, with 40,900 refugees 
returning during that year. This positive development 
continued in 2021, as 66,000 Burundian refugees 
returned to their country of origin throughout the year, 
primarily from the United Republic of Tanzania (30,100) 
and Rwanda (23,000). 
In 2021, some 36,500 Syrian refugees returned to 
their home country from Türkiye (22,300), Jordan 
(6,800), Lebanon (3,600) and Iraq (3,400). While 
UNHCR does not facilitate refugee returns to Syria, 
together with its partners it supports local communities CHAPTER 5+EXPLORE

Resettlement 
While several countries have signalled their 
commitment to resettlement, demonstrating their 
solidarity with host countries, it is an option for fewer 
and fewer refugees due to a significant reduction in 
the number of places offered by States. Resettlement 
is a crucial protection tool and solution, and is a 
core activity mandated by UNHCR’s Statute, helping 
to protect some of the most vulnerable refugees, 
who may face specific or urgent risks. Of all cases 
submitted by UNHCR to States in 2021, 86 per 
cent were for survivors of torture and/or violence, 
people with legal and physical protection needs, and 
particularly vulnerable women and girls.82 Just over half (52 per cent) of all resettlement submissions 
concerned children.
While the number of refugees resettled grew by 
67 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous year, 
reaching 57,500 according to government statistics, 
it remained substantially below pre-pandemic levels 
(e.g. 107,700 in 2019). In 2021, resettlement arrivals 
constituted just 4 per cent of the 1.4 million people 
globally that UNHCR estimated were in need of 
resettlement.83 During the last decade, this share of 
resettlement needs fulfilled has never exceeded 15 
per cent in any year (see figure 18). This year’s gap 
between the global resettlement needs and the 
number of places offered by States was the second 
largest during the last ten years and only slightly 
smaller than the previous year’s estimate of 2 per cent.

Resettled Remaining resettlement needs
84 Afghans who were evacuated or resettled as part of the United States military exit from Afghanistan in August 2021 are not included in these 
estimates, but through an additional special procedure (“ Operation Allies Welcome ”).In 2021, Canada was the largest receiver of resettled 
refugees, welcoming 20,400 people, more than 
double the 9,200 resettlement arrivals in the previous 
year. Resettled refugees arriving in Canada came 
primarily from Afghanistan (6,100), Syria (4,200) and 
Eritrea (3,700). The United States of America received 
13,700 refugees (43 per cent more than in 2020), 
coming mainly from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (5,200), Syria (2,000) and Sudan (1,100).84 
Sweden, the third largest country of resettlement 
welcomed 6,700 refugees mostly from Syria (2,600) 
and Afghanistan (1,600). Two-thirds of refugees resettled globally were 
supported through UNHCR’s resettlement programme. 
The remaining one-third were resettled through 
other means, most commonly private sponsorship 
programmes, which constitute the majority of 
resettlement arrivals in Canada. 
Overall, most refugees whose resettlement was 
facilitated by UNHCR were previously hosted in 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa region 
(predominately Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt), the East 
and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes region (notably 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, the United Republic of 
Tanzania, and Uganda) and Europe (Türkiye).

85 See Blair et al. (2021)  for the comprehensive Developing World Refugee and Asylum Seeker Policy (DWRAP) dataset on exclusionary policies 
for refugees around the world.Local Integration 
In the absence of the possibility to return safely or be 
resettled, pathways are available in some countries 
for refugees to remain long-term or permanently in 
their country of asylum. Local integration helps ensure 
that refugees can build new lives in these countries. 
While refugees seek asylum in their host country for 
humanitarian reasons, when integrated successfully, 
refugees are empowered to pursue livelihoods to sustain themselves and their families, while 
contributing to the social and economic life of the 
host country. The initial integration period, shortly after 
arrival, is of particular importance for the longer-term 
local integration of refugees in their country of asylum. 
Inclusion in countries’ labour markets has been shown 
to be especially critical during this period. Yet many 
countries, including high-, middle- and low-income 
countries, have exclusionary policies in place that 
limit refugees’ access to the labour markets.85 Such 
40
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 5policies may include restrictions on employment 
or movements, as well as excessively long asylum 
procedures. A wide array of research indicates that 
such policies harm refugees’ ability to integrate into 
the labour market and thereby thwart their ability to 
become self-sufficient and contribute to their host 
country economically. Research from Germany, 
Switzerland and the wider European context has 
shown that if refugees face employment restrictions 
during their asylum period, their long-term success 
in the host countries labour markets is negatively 
affected.86 Similarly, the level and the duration of the 
period of uncertainty during the asylum application 
process is a determinant of refugees’ long-term local 
integration. A study in Switzerland, for example, found 
that refugees who benefited from a faster asylum 
process had higher employment rates than refugees 
who had been in the country for the same amount of 
time but had to wait longer for their asylum decision.87 
This research underscores the negative impact of 
extended periods of uncertainty and inactivity on 
refugees’ longer-term integration prospects. The 
justification typically offered for exclusionary policies 
relates primarily to the prevention of negative 
economic or social effects within the host community. 
A recent study across low- and middle-income 
countries casts doubt on the effectiveness of such 
policies, showing that attitudes towards refugees and 
the impact on income levels within host communities 
do not differ across countries with more or less strict 
exclusionary policies.88 It is clear from the research that 
exclusionary policies hold back the mutually beneficial 
opportunities for refugees and host communities to 
cooperate together. 
Measuring local integration across a diverse set 
of refugee-hosting countries is challenging. While 
there are internationally recommended indicators to 
quantify and compare local integration,89 the current 
availability of data in many countries limits their direct 
86 Marbach et al. (2018)  explore a quasi-experiment in Germany in 2000 that capped the maximum length of employment restrictions during the 
asylum period and find a positive impact for refugees fleeing the Kosovo War five years after arrival; Fasani, Frattini, Minale (2020 ) use data 
on the labour market integration of refugees in European countries between 1985 and 2021 and explore geographic and temporal variation in 
employment restrictions for refugees, finding a negative effect on labour market participation. Slotwinski et al. (2019)  compare employment 
outcomes of asylum seekers across Swiss regions with different levels of inclusiveness in their labour market policies for asylum seekers. 
The findings suggest that more inclusive labour market access regulations have a significantly positive effect (+20%) on the labour market 
participation for asylum seekers, especially those with better employment prospects due to their language abilities. 
87 Hainmueller and Hangartner (2016)  utilize exogenous variation in waiting times for asylum seekers in Switzerland and find that one additional 
year of waiting reduces the subsequent employment rate by 4 to 5 per cent.

some of the country’s municipalities prior to 2003 required a local referendum that decides on the naturalization applications of immigrants. 
Comparing migrant applicants who narrowly won or lost the referendum and following them over a long period, the analysis finds that 
naturalization strongly improved the long-term social integration of immigrants.applicability. Even in high-income countries where 
diverse sets of national and subnational datasets are 
available, statistics differentiating refugees from non-
refugees are rare. In absence of more comprehensive 
alternatives, naturalization is often used as an 
imperfect proxy.
In 2021, an estimated 56,700 refugees from 161 
different countries of origin naturalized in 23 host 
countries. This represented a two-thirds increase 
compared to the previous year and a return to 
pre-pandemic levels (55,000 in 2019). As refugee 
naturalization data reported to UNHCR is limited 
to a small set of countries, European countries are 
overrepresented in the statistics. In 2021, 89 per cent 
of all reported naturalizations occurred in European 
countries. Globally, the Netherlands (45,700), Canada 
(6,300) and France (3,700) reported the most refugees 
naturalizing in 2021. Refugees who obtained their host 
country’s citizenship in 2021 were primarily from Syria 
(30,900), Eritrea (7,900), Iraq (1,700), or Afghanistan 
(1,500) or were stateless (1,700). 
While naturalization may be considered as a proxy or 
end point of a successful local integration process, 
research indicates that the value of naturalization 
goes beyond recognition, providing new citizens 
with a positive boost in their social, economic and 
political integration. Ethnographic work focused on 
the post-2007 naturalization of Burundian refugees in 
the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, provides 
insights into the value of the host country’s citizenship 
for refugees. This includes improved opportunities for 
political participation, better economic opportunities 
through freedom to relocate within the country and 
a greater perceived feeling of safety within the host 
country.90 Similarly, two studies from Switzerland91 
indicate that obtaining Swiss citizenship increased 
refugees’ interest in engaging with the country’s affairs 
and their overall social integration.

95 See: International Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics
96 See: EGRISSMore than 4.3 million people globally were estimated to 
be stateless or of undetermined nationality at the end 
of 2021.92 Not recognized as nationals by any State, 
stateless people are often unable to access essential 
services and enjoy basic rights, including access to 
education or health care, formal employment, voting in 
elections or being able to travel.
The estimate represents an increase of 158,200 
people compared to 2020. It is based on information 
provided by governments and other sources, such 
as quantitative and qualitative studies by UNHCR 
and its partners, for 96 countries (three more than in 
the previous year). Yet, the global figure remains an 
undercount as data on stateless populations or those 
of undetermined nationality is missing or incomplete 
for many countries, including some with known stateless populations. The lack of reliable quantitative 
data continues to pose challenges to effectively 
address statelessness and advocate for solutions. 
Despite this overall challenge, several quantitative and 
qualitative studies were concluded in 2021, including 
in Lebanon93 and the Philippines,94 helping to better 
understand statelessness situations and identify 
appropriate solutions. UNHCR is also strengthening 
efforts to gather more reliable and comprehensive 
statistics on statelessness. This includes 
supporting the development of the International 
Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics,95 in 
cooperation with the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP 
and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS),96 which has 
been mandated by the UN Statistical Commission to 
develop these recommendations.CHAPTER 6+EXPLORE

97 See Global action plan to end statelessness 2014 - 2024The increase in the reported global stateless 
population in 2021 was driven by a combination of 
factors. Firstly, additional countries reported stateless 
population estimates for the first time, following efforts 
to gather data on people affected by statelessness, 
most notably Uganda (67,000) and Rwanda (9,500). 
Secondly, improved registration and coverage in 
countries that already had a registered stateless 
population led to increases. Thirdly, a small proportion 
of the increase was due to new children being born 
stateless, underlining the need to prevent and resolve 
childhood statelessness. 
In 2021, Albania, Chile, Colombia and Turkmenistan 
passed legislation establishing statelessness 
determination procedures. These measures will 
allow stateless individuals there to be recognized as 
stateless and access the rights enshrined in the 1954 
Statelessness Convention and eventually acquire 
citizenship.Significant efforts were made to reduce the number 
of stateless people in several countries. In 2021, 
some 81,200 stateless people, including those of 
undetermined nationality, acquired citizenship or 
had their citizenship confirmed. This is the highest 
recorded annual reduction in statelessness since 
the start of the #IBelong Campaign in 201497 and 
represents a 22 per cent increase from 2020 (or 
almost 18,000 people). Most people who acquired 
citizenship or had their nationality confirmed in 2021 
were in Uzbekistan (32,100) and Côte d’Ivoire (23,400). 
Since the start of the #IBelong Campaign in 2014, 
some 485,400 stateless people, including those of 
undetermined nationality, have acquired citizenship. 
Figure 21 shows the annual global numbers of 
formerly stateless people who were reported as 
having acquired a nationality or having confirmed their 
nationality.

Since 2019, UNHCR has reported on both displaced 
and in situ stateless people. Displaced stateless 
people are simultaneously included in UNHCR’s 
official statistics as refugees, asylum seekers or IDPs 
and in its official statistics for statelessness. Prompted 
by the large-scale displacement of stateless Rohingya 
refugees who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, 
this approach reflects the fact that refugees, asylum 
seekers and IDPs without citizenship require specific 
and appropriate protection responses.In situ stateless people constitute the largest share of 
the recorded global stateless population reported by 
UNHCR. By the end of 2021, this group amounted to 
more than three million, or 71 per cent of all reported 
stateless people. Stateless refugees and asylum 
seekers account for 1.1 million people, or 25 per cent 
of the reported global stateless population. In addition, 
another 150,500 stateless people are internally 
displaced. Stateless Rohingya in Myanmar and 
neighbouring countries constitute the majority of both 
stateless refugees and stateless IDPs.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2021CHAPTER 6UNHCR continues to improve the availability of 
age- and sex-disaggregated data on statelessness. 
In 2021, population statistics by sex were available 
for 60 per cent of the reported stateless population. 
Data disaggregated only by sex was available for 
an additional 14 per cent of the reported stateless 
population. Collecting demographic data for stateless 
people is of high importance to UNHCR, as it assists 
in the design of age- and sex-appropriate responses 
to statelessness. For example, the demographic data 
collected in Côte d’Ivoire is among the most complete 
98 This population includes people with undetermined nationality (93 per cent) and those who are stateless (7 per cent).for any national stateless population. The data 
indicates that children account for 54 per cent of this 
population,98 similar to the large stateless Rohingya 
refugee population in Bangladesh (52 per cent). In 
Côte d’Ivoire, children up to 4 years are the largest 
age cohort. This again underlines the importance 
of addressing the pressing issue of children born 
stateless.
