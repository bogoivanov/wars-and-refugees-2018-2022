11 The new category refers to people who have not been reported under other categories, and includes Venezuelans previously designated 
as “Venezuelans displaced abroad (VDA)”. This change has been made retroactively in UNHCR’s statistics since 2018. The term VDA will no 
longer be used.
12 See: UNHCR’s Refugee Data Finder.  This report’s main focus is the analysis of 
changes and trends in forced displacement 
from January to December 2022 among 
people covered by UNHCR’s mandate.9  
The data presented are based on 
information received as of 31 May 2023 
unless otherwise indicated. 
At the end of 2022, the number of 
forcibly displaced people worldwide 
was estimated at 108.4 million.10 This 
figure encompasses refugees (including 
refugees who are not covered by 
UNHCR’s mandate), asylum-seekers, 
internally displaced people and other 
people in need of international protection. 
OTHER PEOPLE IN NEED OF 
INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION
The category “Other people in need  
of international protection” was first 
introduced in mid-2022 reporting11  
and refers to:
“People who are outside their country 
or territory of origin, typically because 
they have been forcibly displaced 
across international borders, who 
have not been reported under other 
categories (asylum-seekers, refugees, 
people in refugee-like situations) but 
who likely need international 
protection, including protection 
against forced return, as well as 
access to basic services on a 
temporary or longer-term basis.”UNHCR also estimates the population 
that UNHCR protects and/or assists. This 
includes those who have been forcibly 
displaced (refugees, asylum-seekers, 
internally displaced people and other 
people in need of international protection); 
those who have returned home within the 
previous year; those who are stateless 
(most of whom are not forcibly displaced); 
and other groups to whom UNHCR has 
extended its protection or provided 
assistance on a humanitarian basis.  
At the end of 2022 this figure stood  
at 112.6 million people. 
These two categorizations are compared 
graphically below. A detailed breakdown of 
the population that UNHCR protects and/or 
assists is provided in Annex Tables 1 - 23 by 
category and country.
The figures in this report are based on 
data reported by governments, non-
governmental organizations and UNHCR. 
Numbers are rounded to the closest 
hundred or thousand. As some adjustments 
may appear later in the year in the Refugee 
Data Finder,12 figures contained in this 
report should be considered as provisional 
and subject to change. Unless otherwise 
specified, the report does not refer to 
events occurring after 31 December 2022.

The biggest diﬀ  erence between the two categorizations is with people 
who have been internally displaced. When present in these statistics, 
UNHCR applies two diﬀ  erent sources:
IDMC’s IDP statistics collate the total forcibly displaced while those 
IDPs protected/assisted by UNHCR are included in the total population 
that UNHCR is mandated to protect and/or assist.
The two sources of IDP data vary signifi  cantly in certain countries. 
Globally, IDMC reports 62.5 million IDPs while UNHCR reports 
57.3 million conﬂ  ict-aﬀ  ected IDPs at end-2022.
In total, UNHCR reports 4.4 million stateless people. About 1.3 million 
stateless people worldwide are also displaced. Most of them are 
Rohingya, either internally displaced in Myanmar or refugees, mostly 
in neighbouring countries. These 1.3 million are only counted 
as forcibly displaced when calculating the total population that UNHCR

Global Forced 
Displacement
13 The total number of people forcibly displaced is calculated using UNHCR, UNRWA and IDMC statistics. See UNHCR population categories 
explained . 
14 A decade ago, in 2013, the same ratio was 1 in 142; 20 years ago, in 2003, it was 1 in 164, and 30 years ago, in 1993, it was 1 in 118.In 2022, the number of people forcibly displaced by 
persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations 
and events seriously disturbing public order grew by 
21 per cent standing at an estimated 108.4 million 
at the end of the year.13 More than 1 in 74 people 
worldwide remained forcibly displaced as a result,14 
almost 90 per cent of them in low- and middle-
income countries. The end-year total represents 
an increase of 19 million compared to the end of 
2021 – more than the populations of Ecuador, the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) or Somalia. It is also 
the largest ever increase between years according 
to UNHCR’s statistics on forced displacement. Over 
half of the increase was due to record numbers of 
refugees, asylum-seekers and other people in need 
of international protection forced to flee during 
2022 (see figure 1). During the first five months of 
2023, forced displacement has continued to rise and 
UNHCR estimates that the global figure likely exceeds 
110 million people at the time of writing, in May 2023.These figures show us that some people are far 
too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to 
find solutions. The consequence is devastation, 
displacement, and anguish for each of the millions 
of people forcibly uprooted from their homes.

16 In addition, stateless people, third country nationals, and refugees and asylum-seekers hosted in Ukraine before the war were also forced to 
leave the country.
17 Previous estimates of the number of refugees from Ukraine that were published on UNHCR’s Operational Data Portal  were based on 
reports of cumulative applications for asylum and for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes, as well as the estimated 
presence of refugees with various other legal statuses. In June 2023, the estimates have been adjusted to better reflect the number of 
refugees remaining in each country at end-2022, based on data provided by national authorities, including active beneficiaries of temporary 
protection. See the Operational Data Portal  for a more detailed explanation.
18 Figures for refugees from Ukraine are based on official statistics of refugees recorded in host countries by the end of 2022. Figures for Syria 
represent annual flows of refugees since 2011. The trends between datapoints are assumed to be linear. 
19 In 2022, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran conducted a recount of the previously “head counted” population and extended 
the scope of this scheme to all undocumented Afghans residing in the country, including those who had newly arrived due to the Taliban 
takeover in 2021 in Afghanistan. It is reported that 2.6 million Afghans enrolled in this exercise, which provides them with a headcount slip 
and temporary protection from deportation.In February 2022, the Russian Federation’s full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine created the fastest displacement 
crisis, and one of the largest, since the Second World 
War (see figure 2). In the early days of the war, more 
than 200,000 refugees per day sought safety across borders, initially in countries neighbouring Ukraine. 
At the end of 2022, 11.6 million Ukrainians remained 
displaced,16 including 5.9 million within their country, 
and 5.7 million who fled to neighbouring countries 
and beyond.17

While the full-scale invasion of Ukraine undoubtedly 
led to the largest forced displacement crisis in terms 
of magnitude and velocity in 2022, conflict and

estimates of the number of forcibly displaced Afghans 
in the Islamic Republic of Iran became available, 
with many having arrived in earlier years.19 Overall,

21 This constitutes a rise of 18 per cent, or 811,000 people, from a year earlier as population estimates of other people in need of international 
protection were revised upwards in Colombia and Peru. 
22 Temporary protection systems are considered complementary to the international refugee protection regime, being used as an emergency 
response to large-scale displacement to provide immediate protection from refoulement, access to legal status and rights in host countries to 
those fleeing humanitarian crises without undergoing prior individual refugee status determination procedures. 26 European Union Member 
States implemented the Temporary Protection Directive whilst a number of other countries applied similar legal frameworks.

Globally, Türkiye, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Colombia, Germany and Pakistan hosted the largest 
refugee populations at the end of 2022, including 
people in refugee-like situations and other people 
in need of international protection. More than 87 
per cent of all refugees and other people in need 
of international protection originated from just 10 
countries.
Millions of refugees from Ukraine received temporary 
protection, granted by European Union Member 
States and several other countries.22 At the same 
time, the highest number of new asylum applications 
ever recorded – 2.6 million – were registered by 
more than 140 nationalities during 2022 in 155 
countries. The sheer number of people forced to flee 
new or ongoing conflicts around the world underlined 
how critical the right to apply for asylum remains for 
millions of people worldwide. More than 2 in 5 of the 
new asylum applications were made by nationals 
from Latin America and the Caribbean, notably from 
Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Asylum applications by Afghans and Syrians also grew compared to the 
previous year. The United States of America remained 
the largest recipient of asylum applications, receiving 
730,400 new claims, nearly four times more than 
during 2021. Despite 1.3 million substantive decisions 
by States and UNHCR on these asylum applications, 
a 27 per cent rise from 2021 and the most since 
2017, the volume of new applications meant that the 
number of asylum-seekers awaiting a decision on 
their cases climbed 18 per cent to 5.4 million. 
Most people who are forced to flee never cross an 
international border. A t the end of 2022, 58 per cent 
of all forcibly displaced people remained in their own 
country. New internal displacements surged, with 28 
million new displacements due to conflict and violence 
during the year.23 War in Ukraine and conflicts in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and 
Myanmar each displaced more than 1 million people 
within their own country. A further 32.6 million new 
displacements were due to disasters,24 with 21 per 
cent occurring in the Least Developed Countries and

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 1Small Island Developing States, countries that have 
experienced disproportionately high economic losses 
in relation to the size of their economies as a result of 
disasters and climate change.25 
While most people who have been forced to flee want 
to return home, this can only occur in safety and dignity 
if lasting peace is achieved.26 For most displacement 
situations around the world, this remained beyond 
reach in 2022, with just 339,300 refugees reported 
to have returned home. This means that for every 
refugee that returned, 22 people became refugees 
during the year .27 Other solutions for refugees include 
resettlement to third countries.28 The number of 
refugees resettled in 2022 doubled to reach 114,300, 
recovering to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. However, 
this accounted for only a fraction of the projected 1.5 
million refugees in need of resettlement.29
Two positive developments in 2022 included a 
cessation of fighting in Northern Ethiopia, agreed 
in November 2022,30 with 1.9 million IDPs returning 
during the year. In Yemen, the ceasefire coordinated 
by the United Nations expired in October 2022 but it 
continued to be broadly adhered to,31 a step forward 
in a country where more than half of the population 
do not have enough to eat each day32 and 4.5 million 
people remained displaced within the country at the 
end of the year.
What next?
New and ongoing conflicts continue to force people 
to flee in 2023. During 2023, more than 1 million 
people have been forced to flee their homes in 
Somalia due to conflict, floods and drought.33 In April, 
conflict erupted between competing armed forces in

27 During 2022, 5.7 million people displaced within their countries also returned home, while five times more people were newly internally displaced.

them and grant them permanent residence status.

killed in the fighting,34 and the number of acutely food 
insecure people in the country is estimated to be set 
to increase by more than 2 million in the next three 
to six months.35 As of end-May 2023, an estimated 
1.2 million people had been newly displaced within 
the country36 and a further 378,300 had fled to 
neighbouring countries.37 By the end of May 2023, 
the number of people forcibly displaced within 
Myanmar increased by 331,600 from the end of 2022 
to stand at 1.8 million,38 while the number of internally

The surge in global energy and commodity prices 
has negatively affected many countries that were 
already fragile, such as those in the Sahel, a region 
in which millions of people require humanitarian 
assistance, including over 10 million children.41 This 
has been compounded by the lingering impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. While restrictive measures 
during the pandemic have eased worldwide, its 
long-term impacts on the well-being of the world’s 
population are only beginning to be understood. The 
impact has been particularly acute on vulnerable 
population groups such as those forced to flee, 
especially children. For example, by removing 
essential socioeconomic safeguards protecting 
children living in situations of armed conflict (e.g. the 
drastic reduction in household income as a result of 
economic activity halting, the closure of schools, and 
the interruption of public services and humanitarian 
assistance), children have increasingly been exposed 
10
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 1to risks of serious human rights violations,42 such 
as recruitment of children into armed groups, and 
gender-based violence.
Despite these systemic risks, one thing that is unlikely 
to change in 2023 is that most refugees and displaced 
people stay as close to their countries as possible. At 
the end of 2022, 70 per cent of refugees, including 
people in refugee-like situations and other people

three-quarters of these same populations remained

example, of the 15.7 million refugees from countries in 
the Asia and the Pacific region who fled their countries 
between 1975 and 2022, 90 per cent (14.2 million) 
were hosted by other countries in the same region.

Remarkable solidarity continues to be shown for 
refugees and other forcibly displaced populations 
around the world. But this cannot be taken for 
granted and requires greater international support. 
The Global Compact on Refugees,44 affirmed by the 
United Nations General Assembly in 2018, presents 
a blueprint for the global solidarity and responsibility 
sharing needed by the international community. 
This means doing more to ease the pressure on the host countries, enhance refugee self-reliance, 
expand access to third-country solutions, and support 
conditions in countries of origin for voluntary return in 
safety and dignity. The forthcoming Global Refugee 
Forum 2023 will be an opportunity to demonstrate 
that this solidarity remains solid, as States and other 
stakeholders showcase good practices and make 
new commitments in support of refugees and their 
host communities.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 1NOWCASTING OF REFUGEE AND ASYLUM-SEEKER STATISTICS
45 See HungerMap , WFP
46 See UNCTADSTAT , UNCTAD
47 See Refugee Data Finder , UNHCR.UNHCR publishes official statistics on forced 
displacement twice a year. The statistics are 
published 4-6 months after the end of the reporting 
period due to the time needed for data collection, 
validation and verification. For example, UNHCR’s 
annual statistics are published in June and reflect 
the situation as of December in the previous year. By 
contrast, near real-time operational data is available, 
but only for some displacement situations, and the 
data is not always comparable due to inconsistent 
definitions or methodological approaches. 
Nowcasting – predicting the very recent past or the 
present – helps to estimate numbers in situations 
where statistics are not sufficiently timely. In 
humanitarian and development situations, where 
collecting up-to-date statistics is challenging, 
nowcasting can be used to overcome reporting 
delays. Examples of nowcasting initiatives within 
these sectors include the WFP’s HungerMap45 which 
monitors and estimates the current food security 
situation and UNCTAD’s interactive website46 
displaying estimates of current GDP and trade 
indicators.
UNHCR has recently developed nowcasting of 
the refugee and asylum-seeker populations, with 
estimates produced for the previous month on a 
rolling basis. These figures are published monthly, 
and the resulting global estimate has an accuracy of 
close to 99 per cent compared to UNHCR’s official 
global forced displacement figures. As shown in 
figure 5, the latest estimates for May 2023 are 29.7 
million refugees (+1 per cent from the end of 2022) 
and 5.6 million asylum-seekers (+4 per cent from the 
end of 2022).Figure 5 | Nowcasted figures for refugees and

UNHCR’s nowcasting uses a mix of actual data and 
statistical models where actual data is not available. 
These statistical models use historical information 
from various data sources to estimate the current 
refugee or asylum-seeker figures. Prior to 
publication, the nowcasting data is quality assured 
to ensure the process produces the most reliable 
estimates possible with the available information. In 
2023, these figures will be published on UNHCR’s 
Refugee Data Finder website.47 
According to the latest nowcasting data, estimates 
for the monthly asylum-seeker figures until May 2023

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 1indicate an overall upward trend for this population 
in both Europe and sub-Saharan Africa (see figure 6). 
For many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, up-to-date 
operational data is available. By contrast, as official 
monthly data for most European countries is missing, 
estimates tend to be based on statistical modelling. 
Therefore, the uncertainty intervals for the European 
estimates are much broader.During the same period, the estimated refugee 
population in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to 
have increased by 209,600, while in Europe, a slight 
decrease of 90,300 is expected to be observed. The 
decrease in the refugee population in Europe is due 
to fewer Syrian refugees in Türkiye whereas the rise 
in refugees in the three sub-Saharan African regions 
primarily reflects an increase in refugees fleeing from 
Sudan to Chad and other neighbouring countries.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 1Refugees
48 Includes people in refugee-like situations and other people in need of international protection and excludes Palestine refugees under 
UNRWA’s mandate.Overview
The total number of refugees48 worldwide rose by a 
record 35 per cent, or 8.9 million people, to reach 
34.6 million at the end of 2022. The increase was 
largely due to refugees from Ukraine fleeing the 
international armed conflict in their country and 
revised estimates of Afghans in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and Pakistan. This total includes nearly 24.3 
million refugees, 5.1 million people in refugee-like 
situations, and 5.2 million other people in need of 
international protection. All further references to refugees in this chapter include all three of these 
population groups, unless otherwise stated. 
During the year, nearly 5 million people were granted 
international protection, including 717,300 who had 
made an individual asylum claim, 336,800 recognized 
on a group basis and a further 3.8 million people 
who received temporary protection. Precise data on 
the number of other people in need of international 
protection that have received residence permits 
or other forms of legal stay in Latin American and 
Caribbean countries – which host most of them – is 
not available.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022Europe
By the end of 2022, Europe, including Türkiye, hosted 
more than one-third (36 per cent) of all refugees 
(see figure 7). The number of refugees in European 
countries rose from 7 million at the end of 2021 to 
12.4 million at the end of 2022 as millions of refugees 
from Ukraine sought refuge in nearby countries. 
Türkiye remained the largest refugee-hosting country 
in the world, with 3.6 million refugees at end-2022, 
over 10 per cent of all refugees. Germany hosted 
nearly 2.1 million, 6 per cent of all refugees globally.
Asia and the Pacific
The number of refugees hosted in the Asia and the 
Pacific region rose from 4.2 million in 2021 to 6.8 
million by the end of the year, nearly 20 per cent of 
the global total, as updated population estimates in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan became 
available. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a further 
2.6 million Afghans were recorded in a Government-
conducted exercise .49 Previously undocumented 
Afghans, who voluntarily participated in this 
exercise, included new arrivals and those that were 
already in the country, often for many years. In 
Pakistan, a further 178,100 Afghans were recorded 
during the year.
Over 90 per cent of all refugees in the region are 
hosted in just three countries: the Islamic Republic of 
Iran (3.4 million), Pakistan (1.7 million) and Bangladesh 
(952,400). 
The Americas
At the end of 2022, 800,600 refugees and 5.2 
million other people in need of international 
protection resided in countries in the Americas 
region, most of whom were Venezuelan. The total 
of 6 million reflects an increase of 17 per cent from 
49 See footnote 19.end-2021, largely due to updated estimates of the 
number of other people in need of international 
protection in Colombia, which rose by 611,500, and 
in Peru, which increased by 178,400. 
Colombia (2.5 million), Peru (976,400) and Ecuador 
(555,400) hosted the largest populations of refugees 
and other people in need of international protection 
in the region. 
Sub-Saharan Africa
Countries in sub-Saharan Africa hosted 1 in 5 of 
all refugees globally. A total of 7 million refugees 
remained displaced at the end of 2022, a slight 
increase from the previous year. The East and 
Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region hosted 
4.7 million refugees, primarily in Uganda (1.5 
million), Sudan (1.1 million) and Ethiopia (879,600), 
which is consistent with the previous year. West 
and Central African countries hosted 1.6 million 
refugees at the end of 2022, 5 per cent more 
than the previous year. Almost 85 per cent of all 
refugees in the region resided in Chad (592,800), 
Cameroon (473,900) and Niger (255,300). Countries 
in Southern Africa continued to host slightly more 
than three-quarters of a million refugees (773,000), 
with most residing in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (520,500).
Middle East and North Africa
The number of refugees hosted by countries in the 
Middle East and North African region declined by 2 
per cent to stand at 2.4 million at the end of 2022. 
This decrease was due to population verification 
exercises in Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. 
At the end of 2022, Lebanon (818,900), Jordan 
(697,800), Egypt (294,600) and Iraq (273,700) hosted 
87 per cent of all refugees in the region.

51 These models are generated using the available demographic data for a country of origin as a starting point. Where data for a particular 
country of asylum is missing, the values are estimated using statistical modelling from the available data for the same origin country in nearby 
countries of asylum. 
52 The ranges expressed represent the upper and lower 95 per cent uncertainty intervals. Note that the proportion of children amongst 
refugees from Ukraine (33 to 39 per cent) is almost double the proportion amongst the Ukrainian population as a whole (18 per cent).Estimated demographic 
composition of refugees
Every year, UNHCR compiles data globally on the 
combined sex- and age-distribution of the populations 
that UNHCR is mandated to protect and/or assist.50 
At end-2022, demographic data by age and sex was 
available for 76 per cent of refugees and people 
in refugee-like situations and 50 per cent of other 
people in need of international protection. 
Statistical modelling can be used to impute the sex- 
and age-distribution of populations with missing 
demographic data, helping to fill these data gaps with 
estimates.51 Using this approach, children accounted for an estimated 41 per cent of all refugees, and 
women and girls accounted for 51 per cent of the total 
(see figure 8).
Compared with 2021, there were proportionally fewer 
children (-1 per cent), more elderly (+1 per cent) and 
more women and girls (+3 per cent). This is mainly 
due to the additional 5.7 million refugees from 
Ukraine, who accounted for 16 per cent of the total 
refugee population at the end of the year. By contrast 
with most other countries of origin with large refugee 
populations, refugees from Ukraine are more likely 
to be women and girls (estimates range between 59 
and 64 per cent), less likely to be children (between 
33 and 39 per cent) and more likely to be elderly 
(between 7 and 9 per cent).52

DISCLAIMER: ﬁgures are rounded.
BIRTH REGISTRATIONS OF REFUGEES UNDER UNHCR’S MANDATE
Data on the number of children born into refugee status are undercounts, as source data on 
births among refugee populations reported to UNHCR and registered by governments is 
incomplete. To estimate the global number of such children, UNHCR calculated estimates by 
imputing missing birth data for the years between 2018 to 2022.53 A key assumption in the 
estimates is that forced displacement is likely to impact the fertility pattern of refugees. 
Refugees face a situation that is drastically different from that of people remaining in their 
country of origin, and birth rates in the country of origin are not necessarily indicative of 
refugee populations that have fled these same countries. 
Between 2018 and 2022, data on how many children were born into refugee status was missing 
for nearly two-thirds of all refugees globally. The biggest data gaps on birth figures are among 
refugee-hosting countries in Europe. By contrast, in countries in Africa and the Middle East and 
North Africa, less than a quarter of the data on births is missing in each year.
UNHCR estimates that more than 1.9 million children were born as refugees between 2018 and 
2022, equivalent to some 385,000 children per year. The sheer scale of new displacement in 
2022 has led to a larger margin of error than in previous years and has not yet resulted in many 
more births being estimated than in 2021. If the people newly displaced in 2022 remain displaced 
during 2023, these estimates could increase. As this imputation is based on several broad 
statistical assumptions, results should be considered as estimates and not precise figures. 
53 See How many children are born into refugee life?

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 2By country of origin 
More than 87 per cent of all people who were 
refugees at the end of 2022 originated from just 
10 countries, a slightly greater proportion than in 
previous years. Syrians accounted for almost 1 in 
5 refugees globally, with 6.5 million hosted in 131 
countries. Over three-quarters, 77 per cent, resided in 
neighbouring countries including Türkiye (3.5 million), 
Lebanon (814,700) and Jordan (660,900). 
At the end of 2022, over 16 per cent of the world’s 
refugees were Ukrainian. The number of Ukrainian 
refugees increased from 27,300 at the end of 2021 
to 5.7 million at the end of 2022. This was the fastest 
outflow of refugees since the Second World War, 
triggered by the eruption of full-scale war in Ukraine 
following the Russian invasion in February 2022. 
Almost 2.6 million refugees from Ukraine were hosted 
in neighbouring countries, with a further 3 million in 
other European countries and beyond.54
Estimates for the total population of Afghan refugees, 
including people in a refugee-like situation, increased 
54 The United States of America has also offered temporary status in certain circumstances to people in need of international protection. For 
example, in 2022, a significant number of Ukrainians and their immediate family members were given temporary protection on a humanitarian 
basis in the United States. UNHCR is in discussions with the U.S. government about how to best reflect such datapoints for all relevant 
populations in future reporting cycles.
55 See footnote 19.by 2.9 million to 5.7 million. This was largely due to 
the upwards revision of population estimates in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in 202255 which led to the 
recording of 2.6 million more Afghans. Of these, it is 
estimated that 1.6 million arrived prior to the Taliban 
takeover in August 2021, with a further 610,000 
arriving later in 2021 and another 390,000 in 2022. In 
Pakistan, verification and renewal exercises provided 
the opportunity to register previously unregistered 
Afghans in refugee-like situations. At the end of 2022, 
Afghan refugees were hosted in 103 countries. Over 
9 in 10 were in the neighbouring Islamic Republic of 
Iran (3.4 million) and Pakistan (1.7 million). A further 
180,000 Afghan refugees resided in Germany. 
In 2022, the number of South Sudanese refugees 
decreased slightly to 2.3 million. Almost all were 
located in neighbouring countries: Uganda (37 per 
cent of the total or 854,200 refugees), Sudan (35 
per cent, 796,800 refugees), Ethiopia (18 per cent, 
409,400 refugees) and Kenya (7 per cent, 153,300 
refugees).

SDG indicator 10.7.4 identifies the proportion of a country’s population who become refugees.56 As shown in 
figure 10, the countries that have seen the greatest proportion of their national population become refugees 
are Syria (22,400 people per 100,000 inhabitants) and South Sudan (17,300 per 100,000). Reflecting the 
increase in the number of Ukrainian refugees in 2022, the proportion of the Ukrainian population who are 
refugees surged from 76 per 100,000 to 13,600 per 100,000.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 2Table 2 | Key facts for countries hosting refugees, people in refugee-like situations and other people 
in need of international protection, by country of asylum | end-2022
70 per cent were 
hosted by neighbouring 
countries Most people fleeing conflict and persecution remain near their country of origin. By 
the end of 2022, the number of refugees hosted in neighbouring countries dropped 
compared to previous years, primarily because many Ukrainians were hosted in 
countries that do not directly neighbour Ukraine.
76 per cent were 
hosted by low- and 
middle-income 
countriesLow-income countries continued to host a disproportionately large share of the 
world’s displaced people, both in terms of their population size and the resources 
available to them. These countries represented 9 per cent of the global population 
and only 0.5 per cent of global gross domestic product, yet they hosted 16 per cent 
of refugees. This included very large refugee populations in Chad, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda. A further 26 per cent were 
hosted by lower-middle-income countries such as Bangladesh, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, and Pakistan. Upper-middle-income countries, including Colombia, Jordan, 
Lebanon, and Türkiye, hosted 33 per cent of all refugees. High-income countries, 
which account for most of global wealth,58 hosted 24 per cent of refugees at end-
2022. This is a much greater proportion than in recent years due primarily to the 
number of Ukrainian refugees hosted in high-income, mainly European countries.
20 per cent were 
hosted by the Least 
Developed Countries59 The Least Developed Countries consist of 46 countries, including Bangladesh, 
Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda, South Sudan, 
Sudan, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Yemen. Together, they 
account for less than 1.3 per cent of global gross domestic product,60 yet they were 
responsible for hosting more than 20 per cent of all refugees worldwide. This is 
down from 22 per cent in 2021 as many new refugees from Ukraine were hosted 
in high-income countries. At the end of 2022, the number of refugees in Least 
Developed Countries stood at 7 million.
67 per cent were in 
protracted situationsProtracted situations are defined as those where more than 25,000 refugees from 
the same country of origin have been in exile in a given low- or middle-income 
host country for at least five consecutive years.61 This definition should be seen 
as a reflection of the situation as a whole and does not refer to circumstances of 
individual refugees.
At the end of 2022, an estimated 23.3 million refugees and other people in need 
of international protection were in a protracted situation, 7.1 million more than the 
previous year. There were 57 protracted situations in 37 different host countries. 
Some of the protracted situations are relatively recent, such as the Venezuelans 
within Colombia and other countries in the Americas region. Others, such as Somali 
refugees in Kenya, have been in prolonged displacement for decades. 
58 High-income countries account for 61 per cent of global gross domestic product (Source: World Bank GDP statistics ). This compares with 0.5 
per cent, 9 per cent and 28 per cent for low-, lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries respectively. 0.1 per cent of refugees are 
hosted in countries where, due to a lack of reliable income data, an income group classification was not available. 
59 There are 46 Least Developed Countries . These are typically low- or lower-middle-income countries confronting severe structural 
impediments to sustainable development. The list of countries is revised every three years. 
60 See World Bank GDP statistics.
61 Includes people in refugee-like situations and other people in need of international protection. Palestinian refugees under UNRWA’s mandate 
are excluded from this analysis.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 2Internally Displaced 
People
62 See 2023 Global Report on Internal Displacement , IDMC. 
63 At end-2022, UNHCR reported IDP populations in 34 countries. In addition, the 98,900 IDPs in Pakistan that were displaced by conflict in the 
Tirah valley are now reported by the government to have returned.
64 In total, UNHCR responded to 52 emergency declarations, of which 14 were IDP emergencies and 1 response included both refugees and IDPs.Key global developments in 2022
People forced to flee due to armed conflicts, 
generalized violence, or human rights violations and 
who remain within their own countries are known as 
internally displaced people (IDPs). As in previous years, 
IDPs constitute the majority of the forcibly displaced 
population globally, some 58 per cent at the end of 
2022.62 By year-end, UNHCR reported on situations 
of internal displacement in 35 countries,63 and all the following figures in this chapter relate to IDPs protected/
assisted by UNHCR, unless otherwise indicated. 
Over the last decade, the number of IDPs protected/
assisted by UNHCR has doubled, reaching 57.3 million 
at the end of 2022, an increase of 12 per cent from the 
previous year. A total of 15 countries hosted more than 
one million IDPs, rising from 12 in the previous year, as 
the number of people who were internally displaced 
grew in Ukraine, Myanmar and Mozambique.

In 2022, UNHCR responded to 15 IDP emergency 
declarations.64 These 15 emergency declarations 
were made in relation to displacements caused by armed conflict, generalized violence, and climate 
shocks, including drought, flooding or cyclones, or a 
combination thereof and occurred across all regions. CHAPTER 3+EXPLORE

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022UNHCR continued its critical leadership role 
in reinforcing IDP laws and policies, including 
supporting States to develop and implement 
national laws and policies on internal displacement. 
IDP law-making processes significantly advanced in 
Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mexico 
and South Sudan.
Changes by regions and countries 
In countries where UNHCR is engaged with IDPs, at 
least 15.8 million new displacements65 due to conflict and 
violence were recorded by governments or partners in 
22 countries during 2022. Almost half of these occurred 
in Europe, in contrast to recent years when more than 
three-quarters of all new internal displacements occurred 
in sub-Saharan Africa (see figure 13).66
Following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 
February 2022, the front lines of the war shifted 
over time, triggering waves of displacement, 
returns and onward movements. Estimates of new 
displacements during the year therefore range from 
7.2 to 16.8 million.67 
65 Statistics on new displacements that have occurred during the year may include people that have been displaced more than once or that may 
already have returned to their place of origin or moved onwards during the year.
66 Sub-Saharan Africa includes three regions: East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes, Southern Africa and West and Central Africa.
67 The figure of 7.2 million is based on the largest number of IDPs that have been estimated to be displaced (see the IOM DTM May 2022 report ) 
subtracting the 854,000 people that were already internally displaced at end-2021. The figure of 16.8 million new displacements includes 
people displaced more than once and is estimated by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre – see the 2023 global report on internal 
displacement.

72 See Nearly 1 million people have fled five years of northern Mozambique violence , UNHCR.Beyond Europe, some 2.6 million people were 
reported as newly displaced within their countries 
in 2022 in the East and Horn of Africa and the 
Great Lakes region, most commonly in Ethiopia, 
Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan (see figure 12). 
The conflict in Northern Ethiopia led to almost 
one million additional new internal displacements 
in 2022, before a peace agreement was signed 
in November 2022.68 An estimated 783,000 
people fled their homes in Sudan due to ongoing 
intercommunal conflict and violence that followed 
the military coup in October 2021.69 In Somalia, 
607,300 people were newly displaced due to 
persistent insecurity and drought, with the situation 
deteriorating as the year progressed. In South 
Sudan, violence erupted in Unity, Upper Nile and 
parts of Jonglei states in 2022 and led to nearly 
288,200 new displacements within the country.70 
In the Southern Africa region, more than 2.6 million 
people were newly displaced during 2022, with most 
forced to flee within the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (at least 2 million) as insurgencies escalated in 
North and South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.71 A further 
half a million (566,600) people in Mozambique were 
newly displaced due to the ongoing insurgency in the 
northern province of Cabo Delgado.72

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 3In the West and Central Africa region, there were 1.3 
million new displacements in 2022. In Burkina Faso, 
continued fighting between government forces and 
non-state armed groups led to 409,500 new internal 
displacements, while in the Central African Republic, 
334,700 new displacements were reported due to 
conflict and violence in several regions.73
In the Asia and the Pacific region, there were 
1.4 million people newly displaced within their 
countries, almost all in Myanmar (1.2 million) due 
to widespread violence following the military 
takeover in February 2021.74 In the Philippines, 
some 111,000 new displacements were reported, 
most in Maguindanao province as government 
forces clashed with non-state armed groups. In 
Papua New Guinea, conflict- and election-related 
violence escalated and led to 64,000 new internal 
displacements in the country.75 
In the Middle East and North Africa, there were 
442,000 new displacements in 2022, with over 
half in Yemen (234,300) and a further 170,800 in

77 The National Victims Registry of Colombia contains the historical accumulated figure of the number of victims of displacement which continues to 
increase, with new displacements that continue to be registered. The total number of persons recognized as victims of displacement (more than 8.4 
million), includes the number of IDPs who are subject to attention and/or reparation, i.e. those who meet the requirements to access the measures of 
attention and reparation established in Colombian Law 1448 (6.8 million). The number of victims of displacement who are deceased, direct victims of 
forced disappearance and homicide, and other victims who, for various reasons, cannot effectively access these measures, are identified as not being 
subject to attention or reparation and therefore not included in the figure of 6.8 million. Cut-off date: 31 December 2022. Source: unidad victimas .Syria. In Yemen, the ceasefire coordinated by the 
United Nations began in April 2022 and despite 
lapsing in October 2022 has continued to be 
broadly adhered to.76
In the Americas region, new internal displacements 
were only reported in Colombia, totalling an 
estimated 214,700 during the year. 
Internal displacement overview
At the end of 2022, nearly 4 in 5 IDPs protected/
assisted by UNHCR (79 per cent) remained 
displaced in just 10 countries worldwide (see figure 
14). Colombia77 and Syria continued to report the 
largest number of people displaced within their own 
countries (6.8 million in each), consistent with the 
end of the previous year. This means that 1 in 3 of 
all Syrians remaining within their country were still 
internally displaced at end-2022, after more than a 
decade of conflict.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 3In Ukraine, the number of people remaining internally 
displaced at end-2022 stood at 5.9 million, a seven-
fold increase from end-2021, following the full-scale 
invasion of the country in February 2022.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has the 
largest IDP population in sub-Saharan Africa and, at

amongst the Ukrainian population as a whole (18 per cent).end-2022, the population stood at 5.5 million, slightly 
higher than at the end of the previous year. Yemen 
and Sudan also both saw increases in the number of 
people remaining displaced within each country at 
the end of the year (+6 per cent to 4.5 million and +17 
per cent to 3.6 million respectively).

Demographics of IDPs
Reliable demographic and sub-national estimates 
of the number of people forcibly displaced within 
their countries help improve the efficiency of the 
operational response by UNHCR and its partners to 
protect and assist IDPs. In 2022, sub-national data 
on internally displaced people was available for 
28 countries, five more than in 2021. Based on the 
available data, nearly 3 in 5 IDPs live in urban areas 
(59 per cent) and as more sub-national data becomes 
available, it is likely that this proportion will increase 
given the context in the countries with missing data.
Age- and sex-disaggregation was available in 13 
countries, and sex disaggregation was available for 
a further seven countries, one country more than 
in 2021. Overall, age- and sex- disaggregation was 
available for 45 per cent of IDPs protected and/
or assisted by UNHCR and sex-disaggregation was 
available for 64 per cent of this population.
Women and girls accounted for 52 per cent of all 
IDPs, slightly higher than in the previous year. The 
percentage of IDPs that are women and girls in each 
country varied considerably, from 46 per cent in 
Sudan to 57 per cent in Ukraine. 
Some 40 per cent of IDPs were children, lower than 
in previous years (e.g. 45 per cent in 2021), primarily due to the lower proportion of children reported 
within the IDP population in Ukraine compared 
to other countries.78 In Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, 
Niger, Somalia and Sudan children constituted more 
than half of the total IDP population in each country, 
while in Colombia, Georgia and Ukraine, children 
accounted for between 21 and 28 per cent of the 
IDPs in each country.
Displacement in the context of 
disasters 
In addition to conflict and violence, people were 
displaced within their countries due to disasters. 
During the year, 32.6 million internal displacements 
due to disasters were reported, with 8.7 million 
people remaining displaced at the end of 2022, 
according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre. Disaster related internal displacement 
accounted for more than half (54 per cent) of all new 
displacements in 2022. 
The largest number of people displaced within their 
countries due to disasters was reported in Pakistan 
(8.2 million) following extensive flooding across the 
country. In the Philippines and China, cyclones, floods 
and tropical storms led to the displacement of 5.4 
million and 3.6 million people respectively.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 3Asylum trends
79 Refugee status can be granted individually or on a group basis. Group recognition most commonly takes place when there are readily 
apparent, objective circumstances in a country of origin which suggest that most individuals fleeing from that country are likely to be 
refugees. In most cases, those being granted refugee status on a group basis will be directly registered as refugees, as opposed to those 
recognized on an individual basis who will first be registered as an asylum-seeker. This is why individuals undergoing group determination 
will normally not be counted in the “asylum application” total.Overview
Refugee Status Determination (RSD) is the process by 
which governments or UNHCR determine whether a 
person seeking international protection is a refugee, assessing asylum claims against the legal criteria 
in international, regional and national law. Fair and 
efficient asylum systems are a crucial step in ensuring 
that refugees receive protection, solutions are 
achieved and public confidence in the asylum system 
is maintained.

Refugee status can be determined in either individual 
or group procedures.79 When refugee protection 
is determined in group procedures, it is normally 
provided when the claim is registered. Therefore, 
those receiving protection in this manner are not counted within the number of new individual 
applications. Individual procedures are primarily in 
place in the Americas and Europe, while most group 
refugee recognitions take place in Africa. In addition 
to group and individual refugee protection, in some CHAPTER 4+EXPLORE

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022circumstances individuals that would otherwise apply 
for refugee status instead apply for, and are granted, 
temporary protection. Temporary protection is 
considered to be complementary to the international 
refugee protection regime. It can be an effective tool 
to use in the context of large-scale displacement 
to provide immediate protection from refoulement, 
access to legal status and rights in host countries. 
In 2022, nearly 2.9 million individual asylum 
applications were registered in 162 countries by 
States or UNHCR worldwide. This is the highest 
number of individual asylum applications ever 
recorded, representing a 68 per cent increase from 
2021 and nearly 30 per cent more than reported 
in 2019 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 
almost 2.6 million were new individual applications 
registered at first instance80 (that is, for an initial 
determination of the asylum claim by, primarily, 
administrative authorities), while 324,200 were repeat 
or appeal applications for review by courts or other 
appellate bodies.81
The number of new individual asylum applications 
increased by 83 per cent compared to 2021. The 
increase in the number of new individual asylum 
applications submitted to States or UNHCR in 2022 
(from 1.4 million to 2.6 million) shows the impact of 
new and existing displacement situations worldwide, 
with people forced to seek international protection 
in ever greater numbers as well as an uneven 
protection space and assistance landscape in 
countries of asylum. It also reflects the relaxation in 
early 2022 of global travel restrictions, put in place 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented 
people from moving in 2020 and 2021. Compared 
with 2019, the increase of new asylum applications 
in 2022 represents a 31 per cent increase. More 
than 2 in 5 new applications (42 per cent) were 
made by nationals of countries in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, notably Venezuela (+186 per cent 
to 264,000), Cuba (a six-fold increase to 194,700), 
Nicaragua (+49 per cent to 165,800),82 Colombia 
(+184 per cent to 90,500), Honduras (+33 per cent to 
79,700) and Haiti (+10 per cent to 73,500).
80 Data for some countries may include a significant number of repeat applications if an applicant has submitted at least one previous 
application in the same or another country.
81 Statistical information on outcomes of asylum appeals and court proceedings is underreported in UNHCR’s statistics, particularly in high-
income countries, as this type of data is often either not collected by States or not published.
82 In 2022 in Costa Rica, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (only October to December) started their applications by obtaining an appointment to 
formalize their asylum claim. The appointment process for Nicaraguans and Venezuelans ended in December 2022.
83 Excludes the 3.8 million Ukrainians that have received temporary protection.
84 Substantive decisions include Convention status, complementary and other forms of protection, and rejected cases.Increases in the number of individual new 
applications registered by Afghans (+66 per cent to 
208,500), Ukrainians (a 14-fold increase to 152,000)83 
and Syrians (+34 per cent to 147,600) were also 
reported in 2022. Europe and the Americas remained 
the two regions receiving the largest number of 
individual applications in 2022 (see figure 15), with 
over half of all new individual applications registered 
in just five countries: the United States of America, 
Germany, Costa Rica, Spain and Mexico.
Another 4.2 million people were granted 
international protection on a group basis or 
received temporary protection, 13 times more than 
in 2021 (309,400). This mainly includes refugees 
from Ukraine who received temporary protection 
in countries within the European Union or similar 
national protection schemes in Europe. 
During the year, over 1.3 million individuals received 
a substantive decision84 on their individual refugee 
claim, a 27 per cent increase on the previous year, 
showing a good increase in productivity. Of these, 
close to 717,300 individuals were granted refugee 
or other protection status in 146 countries, while 
585,300 were rejected. 
In 2022, some 51,700 unaccompanied or separated 
children (UASC) lodged new asylum applications, an 
89 per cent increase from the previous year, in line 
with the overall increase in new applications. While 
the number of countries reporting on UASC has 
increased from 50 in 2021 to 56 in 2022, information 
remains limited and therefore the figures are likely to 
be significant underestimates.
Individual asylum applications 
registered
By country of asylum
About 71 per cent of new individual applications 
in 2022 were registered in just 10 countries, as 
shown in figure 16. Apart from Mexico, which 
30
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 4saw a 10 per cent decrease, the number of new 
asylum applications in each of these countries 
increased in 2022 compared to the previous year, 
including in Austria (+175 per cent to 109,800), 
Canada (a three-fold increase to 94,400), and the 
United States of America (a three-fold increase to 
730,400).In both the Democratic Republic of the Congo (-91 per 
cent to 4,100) and Uganda (-38 per cent to 25,500) 
– two countries with significant new applications 
in 2021 – large drops in the number of new asylum 
applications were reported in 2022. Both countries 
did continue to see significant numbers of new 
arrivals granted refugee status on a group basis.

By country of origin
Of the 2.6 million new individual asylum applications, 
56 per cent or 1.4 million asylum applicants originated 
from just 10 countries (see figure 17).
In the Americas, the number of Venezuelans who 
sought asylum during the year totalled 264,000, 
nearly three times as many as during the previous year (92,400). Applications by nationals of other countries 
in the region also grew in 2022 compared to 2021, 
with 217,800 new individual applications lodged 
during the year by nationals from these countries. 
While new asylum applications from these countries 
were primarily registered within other countries in the 
region, with the highest number lodged in the United 
States of America, Costa Rica and Mexico, a significant 
number also sought asylum in Spain.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 4Some 359,100 new individual applications were 
registered in 2022 by nationals of European 
countries, more than triple the previous year’s 
total. This increase was driven by sharp rises in 
applications registered by nationals of Albania 
(+99 per cent to 26,800), Georgia (+135 per cent 
to 30,500), the Russian Federation (a three-fold 
increase to 36,500) and Ukraine (a 14-fold increase 
to 152,000). Applications from nationals of countries 
within Europe were lodged in 122 countries, including 
France and Germany.
The number of new individual asylum applications 
by nationals of countries in the Asia and Pacific 
region in 2022 was 454,000, an increase of 78 
per cent compared to the previous year. Afghans 
submitted 208,500 new applications in 2022, the 
second largest number of applications globally, in 87 
countries, including Austria, Germany, Türkiye and the 
United States of America. Other notable increases in 
new applications were seen from Indians (a three-
fold increase to 58,200), Pakistanis (+69 per cent to 
41,000), Bangladeshis (+88 per cent to 38,900) and 
Iranians (+44 per cent to 29,600). Conversely, the 
number of new individual applications by Myanmar 
nationals decreased in 2022 by 37 per cent to 13,500.
In 2022, new asylum applications by nationals of 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa region 
increased by 40 per cent to 288,400. Just over half 
of these applications were by Syrians, primarily in 
Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands (Kingdom of 
the). In addition to Syrians, new applications were 
most commonly registered by nationals of Iraq (-5 per 
cent to 36,000), Tunisia (+129 per cent to 22,000), 
Morocco (+54 per cent to 23,000) and Egypt (+118 per 
cent to 19,000).
Nearly 175,300 nationals of countries in the East and 
Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region made their 
first individual application for asylum in 2022, 25 per 
cent more than in 2021. Applications by Sudanese 
(+71 per cent to 38,500), Eritreans (+27 per cent 
to 38,000), Somalis (+ 7 per cent to 34,400) and 
Ethiopians (-2 per cent to 24,100) accounted for more 
than three-quarters of all applications from the region. 
85 See UNHCR’s strategic direction on RSD.
86 Unlike a State, which has the power to grant legal status in its territory after an RSD decision, such decisions under UNHCR’s mandate may 
not have a protection impact for the individual involved, depending on the specific context.
87 The reduction in the number of countries reporting UNHCR mandate RSD applications between 2022 and 2021 was due to changes in the 
number of countries receiving very low numbers of applications throughout the year.As detailed below, many others from this region 
found protection through group procedures. 
New individual asylum applications by nationals from 
countries in West and Central Africa decreased by 
12 per cent in 2022 compared to 2021 and totalled 
129,800. New applications were most commonly made 
by nationals of Burkina Faso (an eight-fold increase to 
29,900) and Nigeria (-3 per cent to 26,400), with most 
individual applications lodged in Niger (30,400).
In Southern Africa, two-thirds (43,100) of the 62,000 
new applications from countries in the region were 
from nationals of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, 25 per cent more than in 2021.
In order to effectively address the large number of 
applications, UNHCR continues to support States 
to put in place fair and efficient asylum procedures. 
Such procedures ensure efficient identification of 
those in need of international protection as well as 
those who are not in need, which reduces the burden 
on asylum systems and can facilitate prompt returns.
By asylum authority
In line with the objectives of the Global Compact on 
Refugees, UNHCR continues to focus on building and 
strengthening national asylum systems in countries 
where fair and efficient procedures are not yet in 
place. Since 2015, UNHCR has also implemented a 
strategic direction on RSD,85 focusing on reducing its 
RSD activities and engaging in determination under 
its Mandate only in situations where there is likely 
to be a substantive protection impact, at either the 
individual, population, or operational level.86 Examples 
of this could include solutions (such as resettlement), 
documentation or facilitating access to services. 
In 2022, UNHCR registered 149,100 asylum 
applications for RSD in 46 countries. Of these, 
133,500 asylum applications required RSD, a 53 
per cent increase from the 86,800 applications in 
47 countries in 2021.87 This increase is partially due 
to RSD conducted for increased opportunities for 
resettlement. The highest number of new applications 
in 2022 were recorded in Pakistan (28,500), Egypt 
(27,300) and Libya (20,200).

Group determination of 
refugee status and temporary 
protection
During the year, a total of 3.8 million people were 
granted temporary protection, and 336,800 were 
recognized as refugees on a group basis. Of those 
granted temporary protection, 98 per cent were Ukrainians. Most refugees recognized on a group 
basis were hosted in African countries, including 
99,700 South Sudanese (primarily in Sudan, 
Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya), 53,900 nationals 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (in 
Uganda), 28,500 Malians (mainly in Burkina Faso 
and Mauritania), and 27,200 Nigerians (mainly in

Decisions on asylum applications 
88 Substantive decisions include Convention status, complementary and other forms of protection, and rejected cases.
89 Examples of reasons for a case being closed without a decision made on its merits are the death of the applicant, no-show for interview, 
withdrawal of the application, abandonment of the claim, or the determination that another country is responsible for the claim.In 2022, over 1.3 million individuals received 
substantive decisions88 on their refugee claims, a 
27 per cent increase from the previous year as the 
efficiency of asylum systems increased to address 
the high number of applications. Additionally, 
666,400 cases were closed without a decision for 
administrative reasons.89Of the 1.3 million substantive decisions, 97 per cent 
were made by governments, while 43,400 were made 
by UNHCR under its mandate (+73 per cent from 
25,000 in 2021). A further 400 substantive decisions 
were made jointly by UNHCR and governments.Map 3 | Asylum-seekers (with pending cases) | end-2022

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 4The global Total Protection Rate,90 which measures 
the percentage of substantive decisions that resulted 
in some form of international protection, increased 
from 48 per cent in the previous year to 55 per cent 
in 2022. This increase was primarily due to high 
recognition rates among Ukrainian asylum-seekers.
Pending asylum claims
The number of asylum-seekers waiting for a decision 
at the end of 2022 stood at 5.4 million, an increase 
of 18 per cent from the end of 2021. The growing 
asylum backlog exists despite more RSD cases 
being finalized (i.e. a substantive decision has 
been made on the case) in 2022 than in any year 
since 2017 and reflects the sheer volume of new 
applications. In the United States of America for 
example, the number of substantive decisions on 
cases increased by 59 per cent compared to 2021, 
while new asylum applications grew nearly three-fold 
90 UNHCR uses two rates to compute the proportion of refugee claims accepted. The Refugee Recognition Rate is the proportion of asylum-
seekers accorded refugee status out of the total number of substantive decisions (Convention status, complementary protection and rejected 
cases). The Total Protection Rate is the proportion of asylum-seekers accorded refugee status or a complementary form of protection relative 
to the total number of substantive decisions. Non-substantive decisions are, to the extent possible, excluded from both calculations. For the 
purposes of global comparability, UNHCR uses only these two rates and does not report rates calculated by national authorities.
91 In South Africa, all refugees and asylum-seekers with valid permits were considered to be active during the COVID-19 pandemic era as 
long as their permit’s expiry dates were after the breakout of the pandemic. With the resumption of normal services in 2022, many permits 
have been inactivated and are therefore considered to be administrative closures. In total, some 72,200 individuals either did not extend 
their permits or the extended permits became inactive by the end of the year. Individuals whose permits have been inactivated can reapply 
although asylum-seekers and refugees have reported challenges in accessing the online renewal system.during the same period. This underscores the need to 
implement efficient procedures for processing asylum 
applications, including differentiated case processing 
modalities, and group recognition. In appropriate 
cases this can also include protection-sensitive stay 
arrangements as a complement to the asylum system, 
which enables faster access to protection and access 
to services, such as the temporary protection granted 
to refugees from Ukraine in the European Union. 
A growing backlog can create protection concerns 
if asylum-seekers wait many years without legal 
certainty, and it is more difficult for rejected applicants 
to return to their country of origin.
In 2022, 43 countries were able to reduce their 
backlog of pending cases, and these included 
significant reductions in Malawi, South Africa91 and 
Uganda. Conversely, the backlog increased in 92 
countries during the year. Increases were greatest in 
Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, the United Kingdom and 
the United States of America.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 4Solutions
92 See The Global Compact on Refugees  and the UN Secretary-General’s Action Agenda on Internal Displacement .Overview
Durable solutions enable refugees and internally 
displaced people (IDPs) to rebuild their lives in 
safety and dignity. They are a strategic priority for 
UNHCR and the humanitarian and development 
communities.92 While the number of refugees 
and IDPs who found a solution increased in 2022 
compared to the previous year, durable solutions 
continue to remain a reality for very few people. 
Reliable statistics on durable solutions for IDPs are 
often not readily available and can be difficult to 
collect. During 2022, at least 5.7 million IDPs returned 
to their place of origin, 8 per cent more than during 
the previous year. For refugees, durable solutions include voluntary 
repatriation, local integration and resettlement to a 
third country. Complementary pathways and family 
reunification can also expand third country solutions, 
easing pressure on host countries and enhancing 
refugees’ self-reliance by building their capacities 
to attain a solution, including through education 
pathways or labour mobility. During the year, 339,300 
refugees returned to their country of origin, while 
114,300 refugees were resettled to a safe third 
country (-21 per cent and +99 per cent respectively 
compared to 2021). Despite the increase in global 
resettlement, as the number of newly displaced 
refugees surged in 2022, the ratio between new 
refugees and refugees benefiting from a solution 
increased to its highest ever level (see figure 20). For 
each refugee that returned or was resettled in 2022, 
there were 16 new refugees. CHAPTER 5+EXPLORE

93 The figure refers to refugee returns from Sudan which occurred during 2022. Given the deteriorating security situation in Sudan at the time of 
writing, refugee returns to South Sudan from Sudan are expected to increase in 2023, with 86,600 returnees reported (see Sudan situation 
on the operational data portal , as of 31 May 2023).Refugee returns
In 2022, 339,300 refugees voluntarily returned to 38 
countries of origin, a decrease of 90,000 or 21 per 
cent compared to the previous year (see figure 21). 
Refugees from South Sudan continued to constitute the largest groups of returnees, with 151,300 
returning in 2022 primarily from Uganda (75,500), 
Sudan (48,900)93 and Ethiopia (23,300). In 2022 and 
previous years, returns to South Sudan have been 
difficult to verify, as they tend to be self-organized, 
and it can be difficult to reach the areas to which 
many people return.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 5UNHCR does not promote refugee returns to Syria, 
however, together with its partners, UNHCR supports 
local communities receiving returnees. Some 51,300 
Syrians returned to their country during the year, an 
increase of 14,800 from 2021, with two-thirds of the 
refugees returning from Türkiye. UNHCR conducted 
the seventh return intention survey among Syrian 
refugees in early 2022.94 Of those refugees surveyed, 
slightly less than 6 in 10 hoped to return to Syria in 
the future, a small decrease compared to the previous 
survey. Only two per cent planned to return to Syria 
in the next 12 months, with around three-quarters 
of the others planning to stay in their host countries 
for now. Safety and security concerns and the lack 
of livelihood opportunities in Syria were refugees’ 
greatest concerns when considering returning. 
Statistics on returns to Syria corroborate the survey 
findings - a total of 147,600 returns were reported 
between 2018 and 2022 from the four countries in 
which the survey was conducted, equivalent to 1-2 
per cent of the refugees returning in each year. 
Other notable returns during the year included 
Cameroonian refugees returning from Chad 
(30,800), Ivorian refugees returning from Liberia 
(12,900), Nigerian refugees returning from Niger 
(10,700), Congolese refugees returning from Zambia 
(10,200) and Burundian refugees returning from 
Uganda (10,100). 
The Venezuelans authorities have reported that since 
September 2018 over 30,000 other people in need 
of international protection have returned to their 
country under a government organized return plan 
called “Plan Vuelta a la Patria”. Overall, including 
self-organized returns, some 300,000 Venezuelans 
have been reported by the Venezuelan authorities as 
returning to their country during the same period.
Refugee resettlement
Offering resettlement opportunities allows States 
to share responsibility with those countries of 
asylum who welcome large numbers of refugees. 
Resettlement to third countries is a crucial 
94 See Seventh Regional Survey on Syrian Refugees’ Perceptions and Intentions on Return to Syria , UNHCR. Conducted in early 2022, the 
survey covered Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. The survey canvassed more than 2,800 Syrian refugees, out of a total of 2.1 million in these 
countries. In February 2023, a devastating series of earthquakes affected Türkiye and Syria and therefore refugees’ intentions from early 
2022 are unlikely to be representative in the short term.

96 See Resettlement Fact Sheet 2022, UNHCR .protection tool and solution for the most vulnerable 
refugees who may face urgent or specific risks 
and is essential to UNHCR’s mandate. Positively, 
114,300 resettlement arrivals were reported by 
governments in 2022, double the 57,500 during 
the previous year, representing a return to pre-
COVID-19 pandemic levels (see figure 22). Despite 
the increase in resettlement arrivals in 2022, they 
constituted only 7 per cent of 1.5 million people 
globally that UNHCR estimated were in need of 
resettlement.95
Some 55 per cent of refugees resettled globally 
were supported through UNHCR’s resettlement 
programme, with the remainder resettled through 
other means, most commonly private sponsorship 
programmes. Of all the cases submitted by UNHCR 
to States in 2022, 90 per cent of resettlement 
submissions concerned survivors of torture and/or 
violence, people with legal and physical protection 
needs, and particularly vulnerable women and 
girls.96 Submissions by children accounted for 52 
per cent of all resettlement submissions facilitated 
by UNHCR in 2022. 
In line with previous years, Canada received 
the largest number of resettlement arrivals, with 
arrivals increasing by 133 per cent from 2021 to 
47,600 during 2022. Afghans account for 45 per 
cent of all resettlement arrivals to Canada (21,300), 
followed by Syrians (7,600), Eritreans (6,100) and 
Iraqis (2,600). 
Nearly 29,000 refugees were resettled to the 
United States of America in 2022, double the 13,700 
in the previous year. Refugees from the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo represent the largest 
number of resettlement arrivals in the country 
(9,000), followed by Syrians (4,300) and nationals of 
Myanmar (2,900). 
Australia increased its resettlement intake four-
fold from the previous year to 17,300. Refugees 
from Afghanistan (9,600), Iraq (2,500), Syria (1,500) 
and Myanmar (1,000) account for 85 per cent of all 
resettlement arrivals in the country.

97 See definition of naturalization , which is used as a proxy indicator for local integration, UNHCR Refugee Data Finder.Refugee local integration 
Local integration helps ensure that refugees can 
build new lives in host countries.97 It creates an 
environment of long-term stability, empowering 
refugees to rebuild their lives, meaningfully 
participate in the economic and social life of their host 
country and sustain themselves and their families. 
Research in many countries has shown that the initial 
integration period, shortly after refugees’ arrival, is of 
particular importance for their longer-term integration 
in their country of asylum. 
Consistent and globally applicable statistics for 
local integration are difficult to measure and require 
detailed data that remains unavailable in most 
countries. Naturalization – the process by which a 
person can obtain citizenship in their host country 
- is used by UNHCR as an imperfect proxy for 
more comprehensive statistics on local integration. 
Naturalization is relevant as an indicator of local 
integration as it provides essential rights that help to ensure refugees can successfully integrate 
in their country of asylum, including the right to 
stay, unrestricted access to public services and 
participation in political life. Nevertheless, in many 
countries, in order to naturalize, refugees usually 
must fulfil a set of requirements on which it remains 
challenging to collect data. While differing between 
countries, broadly the requirements relate to an 
extended period of stay within the country; a high 
degree of financial self-sufficiency; the ability to 
communicate in the national language of the host 
country and knowledge of its history, culture and 
customs. Even in high-income countries where data 
on naturalization is available, statistics differentiating 
refugees from non-refugees are rare. 
Given the complexity with measuring how many 
refugees have naturalized in many countries, UNHCR 
is exploring other metrics, including the number 
of refugees that have been granted long-term 
or permanent residency. It is expected that such 
statistics will be available in more countries helping 
to provide a more comprehensive indication of local 
40
UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 5integration. While the rights associated with obtaining 
long-term or permanent residency are normally less 
than those granted to refugees that have naturalized, 
such permits ensure that refugees can remain in the 
host country long-term. 
During 2022, at least 50,800 refugees naturalized, 
slightly fewer than during the previous year (-10 per 
cent from 56,700). A total of 28 countries reported 
one or more refugees naturalizing or obtaining 
permanent residence, with most occurring in the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands (23,300). In Canada, 
18,700 refugees obtained a long-term residence 
permit in 2022. Refugees who obtained their host 
country’s citizenship or were granted permanent 
residence in 2022 were primarily from Syria (14,400), 
Eritrea (4,700), the Islamic Republic of Iran (3,300), 
Indonesia (2,200), and Nigeria (2,000).
98 See Ukraine — Internal Displacement Report — General Population Survey Round 11 (25 November - 5 December 2022) , IOM.Returns of internally displaced 
people
In 2022, at least 5.7 million internally displaced 
persons are estimated to have returned to their place 
of origin, 8 per cent more than during the previous 
year. Countries reporting IDP returns in 2022 remained 
broadly consistent with the previous year, with 81 
per cent of IDP returns registered in sub-Saharan 
African countries (see figure 23). A peace agreement 
was signed in Northern Ethiopia in November 2022, 
with 1.9 million IDPs returning during the year. In 
neighbouring Somalia, 607,300 IDPs returned during 
the year. Some 1.2 million returns were also registered 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a further 
404,600 in the Central African Republic and 270,500 
returns in Mozambique. The countries in other 
regions reporting the largest numbers of returns were 
Myanmar (325,200), Syria (255,100), and Afghanistan 
(236,200). While some data on returns within Ukraine 
is available,98 with the fluid security situation in Ukraine 
it remains extremely difficult to determine if people 
who have returned have remained.

UNHCR > GLOBAL TRENDS 2022CHAPTER 5MOVING TOWARDS A VULNERABILITY-ASSESSMENT-BASED APPROACH TO 
DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR IDPS
The international recommendations on internally displaced persons statistics (IRIS) were endorsed by 
the UN Statistical Commission in 2020.99 The recommendations establish a framework for statistical 
definitions and their measurement, including relating to durable solutions for internally displaced 
people. In line with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs,100 
the IRIS outlines that durable solutions for IDPs can be considered to have been achieved once all their 
displacement-related vulnerabilities have been overcome. This can take place in IDPs’ place of habitual 
residence (i.e. through return and reintegration), in their current place of displacement (i.e. through local 
integration), or after settling elsewhere in their country.
Assessing systematically whether IDPs have overcome all of their displacement-related vulnerabilities 
requires a multi-faceted, comprehensive approach that involves comparing the vulnerability situation 
of IDPs with those of the non-displaced population in the same country. For the purpose of statistics, 
the IRIS proposes a simpler composite measure based on only five of the eight criteria set out in the 
IASC’s framework on durable solutions for IDPs. By combining the criteria, the composite measure 
estimates the proportion of the population who should no longer be counted as internally displaced. A 
summary of the five criteria is set out below:
Safety and Security – IDPs who have achieved long-term safety and security are protected from 
threats including those that caused the initial displacement and may cause renewed displacement. The 
degree of protection must be comparable to the one provided to the non-displaced general 
population. IDPs must not be subjected to attacks, harassment, persecution or similar, with special 
emphasis to the vulnerabilities of children and female IDPs. IDPs are not discriminated regarding their 
access to national protection mechanisms, such as police, and are not curtailed in their freedom of 
movement. 
Adequate standard of living – includes at a minimum adequate access to essential food and water, 
basic housing, essential medical care, sanitation and at least primary school education. IDP’s access to 
public services must be on the same level as for non-displaced population groups. 
Access to livelihoods – the employment and livelihoods available to IDPs must fulfil at least their 
core-economic needs. Quality and prevalence of employment opportunities for IDPs, is largely 
affected by country wide factors such as economic fragility and unemployment rates, and a durable 
solution therefore does not imply that all IDPs find employment. However, IDPs’ access to employment 
and livelihood opportunities must be the same as for those who were not displaced. 
Restoration of housing, land and property – IDPs have full and indiscriminatory access to effective 
mechanisms for property restitution and compensation. There must not be any differences in access to 
compensation for IDPs based on gender or age and for IDPs belonging to indigenous groups. 
Access to documentation – IDPs do not face discrimination (based on their displacement status) in 
accessing personal and other documentation for public services, reclaiming property and possessions, 
voting or other purposes. This may require the replacement of documentation lost during the 
displacement, without imposing unreasonable conditions on IDPs. Access right shall not differ by sex 
or age of IDPs. 
Technical guidance on how this composite measure should be implemented by countries is being 
developed by Expert Group on Refugee, Internally Displaced Persons and Statelessness Statistics 
(EGRISS). However, in almost all countries in which people have been internally displaced, the 
availability of data to inform these criteria remains extremely limited. As part of the United Nations 
Secretary General’s action agenda on internal displacement,101 and building upon the IRIS 
recommendations, efforts to generate and improve data to better measure durable solutions in 
situations of internal displacement continue, including by UNHCR.

102 See the definitions of stateless and undetermined nationality  on the Refugee Data Finder. In this chapter stateless people includes people 
with undetermined nationality unless specified otherwise.
103 In 2022, one fewer country overall reported stateless populations, however there were several changes in the number of countries reporting 
very low numbers of stateless people. In 2022, Argentina and Paraguay reported stateless populations for the first time.Overview
People who are stateless or of undetermined 
nationality102 are not recognized as nationals 
by any State and are therefore often unable to 
access essential services and enjoy basic rights, including access to education or health care, formal 
employment, voting in elections or being able to 
travel. At the end of 2022, an estimated 4.4 million 
people worldwide were either stateless or of 
undetermined nationality, 90,800 (+2 per cent) more 
than at the end of 2021.

The increase in the number of stateless people is 
mainly due to improved registration and coverage 
in countries reporting stateless populations as well 
as children being born stateless. At the same time, 
progress on resolving statelessness remains slow. 
The estimate is based on data for 95 countries from governments and other sources such as quantitative 
and qualitative studies by UNHCR and its partners 
(see figure 24).103 However, the global number of 
stateless people remains an underestimate as 
approximately half of all countries do not report

report statistics on statelessness, several countries 
only provide statistics for a portion of the known 
stateless population in their territories, and reporting 
between countries is not always comparable due to 
inconsistent criteria for counting who is stateless or of 
undetermined nationality.
To help effectively address statelessness and 
advocate for solutions, more comprehensive data 
collection and reporting mechanisms are needed 
that provide a more accurate understanding of 
the extent of statelessness worldwide . UNHCR’s 
efforts to improve data on statelessness included 
supporting the development of the International 
Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics 
104 See International Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics.
105 See EGRISS.
106 See United Nations Statistical Commission, 54th Session, decision 54/121.
107 Since 2019, UNHCR has reported on both displaced and non-displaced stateless people. Displaced stateless people are simultaneously 
included in UNHCR’s official statistics as refugees, asylum-seekers or IDPs and in its official statistics for statelessness. Prompted by 
the large-scale displacement of stateless Rohingya refugees who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, this approach reflects the fact that 
refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs without citizenship require specific and appropriate protection responses.
108 See Global Action Plan to End Statelessness: 2014-2024(IROSS)104 developed by the Expert Group on Refugee, 
Internally Displaced Persons and Statelessness 
Statistics (EGRISS).105 The IROSS was submitted to 
the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2022 
and was unanimously endorsed in March 2023.106 
The EGRISS and UNHCR will assist countries in 
implementing the IROSS, thereby improving the 
quality of data on statelessness.
At the end of 2022, most stateless people continued 
to be reported in Bangladesh (952,300), Côte d’Ivoire 
(931,100), Myanmar (630,000) and Thailand (574,200). 
About 30 per cent of stateless people globally are 
also displaced (see figure 25).107 Most of them are 
Rohingya, either internally displaced in Myanmar or 
refugees, mostly in neighbouring countries.

Acquisition and confirmation 
of nationality
In 2022, as part of efforts to reduce the number of 
stateless people, 32,400 people acquired citizenship 
or had their nationality confirmed in 32 countries, 
notably in Uzbekistan (9,400), Thailand (6,200) and 
Sweden (6,100). This is the lowest figure since the launch of the 
#IBelong Campaign in 2014 (see figure 26).108 In total 
more than half a million stateless people (517,500), 
including those of undetermined nationality, have 
acquired citizenship since 2014. Despite significant 
progress in some countries to resolve statelessness 
as well as firm commitments in others to address

Important progress was made in 2022 on legal and 
policy frameworks. A total of 13 States improved 
their laws, policies and procedures to prevent and 
reduce statelessness. For instance, Liberia removed 
gender discriminatory provisions which prevented 
women from conferring nationality to their children 
on an equal basis as men, becoming the third 
country to do so since 2014. Nevertheless, at the 
end of 2022, 24 countries still prevent women from 
conferring nationality to their children on an equal 
basis with men. 
The Philippines enacted a law to grant nationality to 
children of unknown parentage found on the territory, 
also known as “foundlings”, and also became the 
first Southeast Asian country to accede to the 1961 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Other 
States, including Benin and the Netherlands (Kingdom 
of the), strengthened their protection frameworks 
for stateless people in line with the 1954 Convention 
relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.
The President of Kenya announced in December 
2022 that the country will initiate a process to 
recognize the Pemba people, estimated at 7,000, as Kenyan citizens. These people will be registered, 
issued documentation and granted nationality. It is 
expected that this will be completed during 2023.
Demographic data on stateless 
populations
The collection of demographic data on stateless 
people is of great importance to UNHCR as it helps 
to develop age- and gender-specific responses to 
statelessness. At the end of 2022, sex-disaggregated 
data was available for 75 per cent of the 4.4 
million stateless people reported worldwide. Data 
disaggregated by both sex and age was reported for 
62 per cent of the population.
Based on the data available for 75 per cent of the 
stateless population, slightly more women and girls 
are stateless (51 per cent) than men and boys. In 
Bangladesh, where the largest stateless population 
is reported, just over half of the stateless populations 
are children (53 per cent).

Number of people
In many cases, statelessness is the result of 
discriminatory laws, policies and practices that 
deny nationality to certain groups of people. When 
thousands of people are left stateless, whole 
communities can be alienated and marginalized, 
which can lead to those people having a poorer standard of living as well as a loss of human 
capital and revenue. Overcoming the barrier that 
statelessness presents to development is essential 
as part of broader efforts to promote human rights, 
social inclusion and development and to achieve 
relevant Sustainable Development Goals.

FRONT COVER
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO . After spending 
the night with host families in the nearby city of 
Bulé, internally displaced people return to their 
temporary accommodation in Plain Savo. They 
previously left their shelters when Plain Savo was 
attacked by armed men, leaving 62 dead. Many 
armed groups across the eastern regions of the 
country – mainly in the Ituri, North Kivu and South 
Kivu provinces – target civilians in violent attacks, 
triggering further displacement and resulting in 
human rights abuses and even deaths.
