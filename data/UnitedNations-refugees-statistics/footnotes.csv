"The UK’s stateless figures show the number of stateless individuals recognised through the UK's stateless determination procedure since it began in 2013.

This resulted in unavoidable double counting for stateless individuals who were applying for further statelessness leave after the expiry of their initial grant of leave. The UK Government has now provided data for initial and subsequent grants. The subsequent grants have therefore been removed from the previous cumulative figure between 2013 - 2018. Since 2019, the cumulative figure now only includes initial grants of leave following individuals’ recognition as stateless.
